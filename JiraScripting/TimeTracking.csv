h1. *Developer Notes*

Here are some places I *DID NOT* change customer service to genetic services, due to the fact that these are special emails that are sent to some of our large customers like Taconic and CNIO or are used as integration points. It is very possible that they may have email rules or programs set up to read these eamils from ""Transnetyx Customer Service"" or ""Customerservice@transnetyx.com"".

Here are the files that I did not change:

 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\Custom_CNIO_OrderConfirmationEmail.sql
 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\Custom_CNIO_OrderConfirmationEmail_Test.sql
 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\NetsuiteInvoiceProblemAccounts.sql
 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\ResultFileTransferFailures.sql
 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\TaconicStrainsRequiringNewTranslations.sql
 - ordermanager\OrderManagerDB\dbo\Stored Procedures\TaconicWellplatesShipped.sql

it also turns out we have been sending all order confirmation emails for CNIO with the ""From"" address as:
customerservices@transnetyx.com  (Notice this is Pluralized with an 's' at the end of customerservice *+s+* )

h2. *Code level Changes:*

per conversation with [~admin] we are not making coding level changes at this time. The only changes made are customer facing changes and UI level changes and email template changes. The ""customerservice@transnetyx.com"" email is hard code in many places in the ORMA code stack, and it is also tied to a user account which is retrieved from the database via the email and coding operations occur around this account. Because there is such a large impact on the actual code level changes and the ability to test most of these changes would be very hard, we are not making these change at this time. The customer will see ""geneticservices@transnetyx.com"" and anything referring to customer service will only be happening in code out of the customers knowledge. Any emails sent programmatically that have customer service as the sender email will be automatically changed at the exchange server level.


h1. +*Application Files that need to be changed:*+

These are file on the server that have ""customerservice@transnetyx.com"" or ""customer service"" in the file. These are the direct path links to the files. They are all PDF files.

Refer to the ""Developer Notes"" section I added to the description above. Let me know what you think.

Genetic monitoring description:
In order to choose the right panel of markers we must know the background of your strain. Outbred strains and fully mixed backgrounds are not suggested for this type of testing.

This test is best used to monitor pure inbred strains and to detect contamination in breeding lines. It can also be used to check the veracity of a newly obtained strains background.

Speed congenics description:
Sex chromosomes must be fixed before testing strats. The best method to fix the Y chromosome is to cross female carriers to wildtype males of the recipient strain to produce F1. The X chromosome is then fixed by mating F1 carrier males to wildtype females of the recipient strain. The offspring of this cross and all subsequent back crosses should then be tested to select the most suitable males for the next back cross.","10/Aug/18 3:14 PM;admin;Adding post deploy data seed script for MVP panels

+Acceptance Criteria+:
* A service call exists to take the MGI ID from the SIF and automatically fetch additional data from the MGI database.
* When a user submits a SIF with an MGI ID that we already have matching a *completed* construct, then the user can name their new strain and they're ready to submit samples.  *No AIM is needed* in this scenario.
* When the user submits a SIF with an MGI ID that we already have matching an *incomplete* construct, then the SIF is sent to the new AD tool and an AIM *is* created.
* When the user submits a SIF with an MGI ID that we have *no* construct existing, then the SIF is sent to the new AD tool and an AIM *is* created.


+Scenario:MGISubmittedCompleteConstructExists+:
*Given* a user begins entering a SIF from Quick Order
*When* the an MGI ID is entered
*Then* search Order Manager constructs
*And* if the construct exists
*And* the construct is complete
*Then* immediately show the user the allele to select as their new strain
*And* allow customer to name strain uniquely for their account
*And* link this customer strain to the construct

+Scenario:MGISubmittedIncompleteConstructExists+:
*Given* a user begins entering a SIF from Quick Order
*When* the an MGI ID is entered
*Then* search constructs
*And* if the construct exists
*But* the construct is incomplete
*Then* send SIF data, MGI data, and incomplete construct to Assay Design Tool to be edited

+Scenario:MGISubmittedNoConstructExists+:
*Given* a user begins entering a SIF from Quick Order
*When* the an MGI ID is entered
*Then* search constructs
*And* if the construct does not exist
*Then* send SIF data and MGI data to Assay Design Tool to be managed

Sync issue causes mice with blank names to be given auto-incremented names,COMA-2679,29537,,Story,QA,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,,wwyatt,wwyatt,wwyatt,06/Aug/18 10:45 AM,30/Aug/18 4:16 PM,22/Aug/18 9:02 AM,,,CM - Release 1.2,,,0,,,,,,,,"h1. Background

This ticket was originally a CMI ticket, but after investigating the issue, [~jstrickland] realized that the issue below is being caused by a sync issue or some functionality with Web app.   This ticket needs more investigation to figure out what is going on.  The below ""what happened"" is just a way to trigger the event.  

See Jeff Strickland's comments and attachments for more details on what is going on with sync.

h1. What happened:

# Web > Select a Breeding
## Edit Breeding
## Turn off Auto-serialize in the Breeding Wizard
## Complete Breeding Wizard to save setting
# iOS > Go to Breedings page
## Create a new litter for the Breeding
## Biopsy new litter
## Give the mice blank IDs
## Sync
# The mice now have random, auto-incremented IDs in _web_ and _iOS_ <- {color:#d04437}CHANGE{color}

h1. What I expected to happen:

When I biopsy mice from the Litter page and set their IDs to be blank, I expect the IDs to remain blank after the sync is complete.

h1. DEV Note

See comments and attachments from [~jstrickland].

Technical Design:
----
I changed this ticket from Bug to Story. The auto-name generation is happening by design to respond to an old  UCSF feature request to do exactly that. (Chris)

Changing this functionality to prevent coalescence of the system generated ID implies that there will be no storage of that ID (the system generated ID is only being stored in the Name field when the user has elected not to name a mouse).

-Based on a brief conversation with Jim, that may not be the solution we are looking for. We will need a backing storage column added to Mice (its entity and business classes as well) to hold the system generated ID, and then future work to display that as a fixed reference ID.- this work has already been completed. -cs

[~bkoch] We can discuss if you need more detail.

CC: [~jcox]","07/Aug/18 8:27 AM;jstrickland;If you blank the names out in the iOS app it will actually send up blank names in the sync but the data returned from the server has names populated.  So this particular thing is server side.

When you create pups in the app it does try to auto name them either basing the names off of the parents name or in that same format the server uses - YYYY####-##.  

This happens on master and isn't due to a change made for CMI-290.

","27/Aug/18 8:49 AM;bkoch;[~wwyatt][~cleduc] just making sure I'm understanding this ticket right, if the ""auto-serialize"" is unchecked, that means that it shouldn't populate any mouse names, and just leave it blank until the user specifies something in?  Has this been an issue in the web previously, since it looks like it's happening on both platforms?

edit - So I looked through the code a bit, and apparently it's not saving the mouse name if the auto-generate ID is off, but it is bringing back the mouse name as the auto-generated system ID if the name is null or empty.  Since it looks like this was explicitly coded in for a reason, do we know if we should allow null or blank mouse names?  Should we default them to something else instead?","27/Aug/18 2:17 PM;wwyatt;[~bkoch], I've spoken with Jim about the code and it was put there intentionally. He'll reach out to [~cleduc] to discuss the issue, so we'll need to wait to hear back from them before moving forwared. Thanks for finding the issue!

CC: [~jmedlock]","27/Aug/18 3:07 PM;cleduc;[~wwyatt][~bkoch][~jmedlock]  [~admin]
We'll have a few meetings and get back to you tomorrow. 

We have a situation of triple labeling of an animal: GUID, scientific name (System ID - not editable by user) and common name (Name - fully editable by user).

For now, what I would think the generic user would expect: 

* If they do not fill in a Name, it would not have a Name. 
* If auto generate name is off, and a Name is blank it stays blank.
* If auto generate is on, and they blank out the Name, the Name should still stay blank. 
* The System ID (not the GUID) could be a running number (date etc as it is now) generated by the system that cannot be edited by the user. 
* The user would expect to be able to view this ID but it is fine if only in list views with column added. 

In the future, if they wanted to use System ID instead of Name (displaying in the modals) maybe we would want a selection as we do for autogenerate. If it's on, System ID is Mouse Name.  I don't think we have room in the card displays/modals for both fields.



","28/Aug/18 3:46 AM;bkoch;Thanks [~cleduc] and [~wwyatt], let me know what the final decision is regarding this when you find out.  If it is to leave the name as whatever they decided to enter in, that's cool for me, just let me know.","28/Aug/18 10:18 AM;cleduc;Thanks [~bkoch] for asking about this! 
Please continue with ticket as written. 
If Mouse ID/Name is blank, do not fill with System ID, regardless of Auto Serialize settings.

(We will create a new ticket to handle the System ID creation and Display in another field).

h1. What I expected to happen

When syncing a cage change in iOS for a group with Cage/Facility Management, I expected the cage changes to sync regardless of cage name.

h1. DEV Note

Basically the ""LinkFacilityCageClaimsToColonyCage"" method should not throw an exception when the cage name is null or blank, it should just return no claims.

In the method ""LinkFacilityCageClaimsToColonyCage"" in the Transnetyx.Facilities.Business.Integration object we need to move line 26 that defines the variable listFacilityCageClaimsToReturn to the top of the method body, and then update the guard clause on line 23 that tests for this: string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(facilityManagementSystemCageId) and instead of having it throw an exception have it return listFacilityCageClaimsToReturn instead.

CC: [~cleduc]","07/Aug/18 8:58 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] [~cleduc] It appears to me that Colony was designed to NOT be able to create a cage without a name (id). iOS works the same way when you update a cage name to blank and sync it, however, it appears that you can create a cage in iOS with a blank name, where you cannot in the web. [~jmedlock] might have some history on that. 

Whether or not it is supposed to work that way, this ticket has nothing to do with that IMHO.

But I just realized that you suggested saving a cage without a Cage ID in iOS, but I tried to do so in Web.  Sorry for the misunderstanding.  Thank you for the heads up about the potential functionality disparity between iOS and Web.  I will add it to a list that [~jcox] and [~cleduc] are working on.

CC: [~jmedlock], [~jstrickland]","07/Aug/18 9:55 AM;jmedlock;[~jcox] [~jstrickland] [~bwinter] [~rwilliams] I do not think the cage name should be null or blank. We changed that on the web to auto populate the name and make it required because it was causing all kinds of issues with other features.
Also we want to make the cage name a number so we can sort it like a number. Correct?

[~cleduc]","07/Aug/18 12:44 PM;bwinter;Ran into an issue testing this ticket.

# In web, change group to UCSF_Rio_Test [key: 8D8JDC2] <- this is a ""Rio"" group with facility management functionality
# Add some strains, mice, and cages
# In iOS, go to UCSF_Rio_Test
# Go to gear and sync Web changes
# Go back to Dashboard
# Dashboard is blank: 0 strains, 0 mice, 0 cages <- {color:#d04437}UNEXPECTED{color}

Messaged [~rwilliams] and [~jstrickland] on Teams.  Depending on investigation, I may need to create a bug ticket that blocks this ticket.","07/Aug/18 3:28 PM;rwilliams;The sync is now working. Not sure what the sync issue was, but at [~jstrickland]'s suggestion, [~bwinter] logged off of the app and logged back in and the sync worked fine. Testing can resume. Thanks guys for working through this so that testing could get completed.","07/Aug/18 3:51 PM;bwinter;The issue was completely user error on my end.  Next time I will log off and log on with each new QA release to iOS.  Thank you, [~rwilliams] and [~jstrickland] for helping figure this out.","08/Aug/18 2:07 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], [~jstrickland], what is the expected behavior if I do this test:

# Web > Create a cage with a Cage Name, say, _Cage 5_
# iOS > Remove cage name (from _Cage 5_ to blank).
# Sync
# Web > Cage name not updated in Web<- {color:#f79232}EXPECTED or UNEXPECTED?{color}
## Cage name in Web is _Cage 5_
## Cage name in iOS is blank (no cage name)","08/Aug/18 2:51 PM;jstrickland;I assume the expected behavior is to never be blank or null (as [~jmedlock] mentioned) so in your example the web result was expected but iOS shouldn't have allowed a blank name.  But I'll let someone else confirm this I'm just making assumptions.

Also If I create a cage on iOS with a blank name and perform a sync it actually will show up as a blank cage name on the web.  So at the very least this is inconsistent.
","08/Aug/18 3:04 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] [~jstrickland] It was behaving this way before this ticket was completed, so as far as this ticket goes, it is expected (because this behavior isn't new or wasn't caused by the code change for this ticket). Whether or not it is supposed to behave like that is a different question all together. As far as I can tell, the application was designed to work this way. I don't like it and I think it could stand some modification to make it a better user experience (like adding validation to the name field so that it doesn't allow the user to submit a blank name), however, that is a business call (as well as another ticket).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

h1. What I expected to happen

Because of changes in COMA-2490, I expected that changing strain linking to new QO strain after an order was submitted would not affect orders in progress and changes would only be applied to new orders.

h1. DEV Note

We are currently not saving to the Order, the OMStrainId that the Colony Strain is linked to in OM/QO. This is a problem if the user changes the link on a Colony Strain to a different OM/QO Strain while an order is being processed. The Results page used the OMStrainId that is currently associated with a strain instead of one from the snapshot. 

We must add the OrderManagerStrainId into one of the Order tables (OrderStrains maybe??) at the same time that we are saving the linked probe data. Chris says be warned that the OrderStrains table gets regenerated frequently, so make sure whatever we do that if we use that table that it always has the linked value in it after regen. 

Also, need to update the Order and Results portion of the code so that it uses the snapshot OM StrainId instead of the one on the Colony Strain table. The precise place in code for this change is line 224 in the OrdersResultsViewModel class. Change from ""strain.OrderManagerStrainId.Value"" to the snapshot version. 

Note: The strain linking snapshot code is in the OrderManager.InitializeStrainMasterProbes(). I think it is during calls to this method that we need to save the OMStrainId as well.",,,,;02/Aug/18 11:01 AM;rwilliams;57600,;03/Aug/18 9:44 AM;admin;300,;14/Aug/18 11:07 AM;bwinter;14400,;16/Aug/18 9:01 AM;rwilliams;300,;16/Aug/18 9:09 AM;jcox;300,,,,,0,72900,,,0,72900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14/Aug/18 11:07 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Changing strain link while order for that strain is in mid-process does not affect that order - 2018-08-13 15_52_39-Automated Genotyping.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27352/PASSED+-+Changing+strain+link+while+order+for+that+strain+is+in+mid-process+does+not+affect+that+order+-+2018-08-13+15_52_39-Automated+Genotyping.png,14/Aug/18 11:11 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Order in Incomplete status are updated with new probes from newly linked QO strain as expected - 2018-08-14 11_09_38-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27353/PASSED+-+Order+in+Incomplete+status+are+updated+with+new+probes+from+newly+linked+QO+strain+as+expected+-+2018-08-14+11_09_38-.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rwilliams,rwilliams,"{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2018-08-03T11:23:58.073-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""bitbucket"":{""count"":1,""name"":""Bitbucket Cloud""}}}}},""isStale"":false}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,admin,,,Unassigned,,bwinter,0|i00rgi:v,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,YX Connect,2018-08-13 21:20:33.824,"13/Aug/18 4:20 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], I added a ""what happened"" to the description of this ticket.

+Acceptance Criteria+:

* When user accesses mouse import page, new UI elements allow user to 
** download XLSX template
** upload data to import
** view logs of past uploads
* When user accesses mouse import page, they are presented with simple instructions on how to use the page; the download XLSX will contain more detailed instructions.
* When a user downloads the XLSX template, the XLSX workbook contains
** _Data_ worksheet giving all the column header names
** _Strains_ worksheet with a grid of all the *GROUP*'s 
*** strain names
*** gene names
*** mutation names
*** translated result
*** system generated genoytpe
*** shorthand
*** any other data useful for adding genotypes.
** _Instructions_ worksheet with more details on how to use the download XLSX 
*** What is expected to be on the _Data_ worksheet?
*** How to use the _Strains_ worksheet?
*** Any other instructions needed to successfully upload colony data
* When the user uploads a XLSX with colony data, 
** a background task processes the imported data.
** the XLSX is saved to the DB with metadata
*** number of mice attempted to import
*** number of mice successfully imported 
*** number of mice failed to import
*** number of mice already existing in Colony at time of upload
* When the user view logs of imported files,
** Display imported files in progress
** Display list/grid of previous imported files with link to download file, date of import, and any other relevant data
* When the user clicks link of imported file in the log, then the downloaded file contains results (success, errors) of upload that can be modified (if needed) and uploaded again

h1. Discussion

h2. Questions about Scope

* Is there a file size limit for the upload?
** +There are limits on the server regarding request size, so yes there are limits, We can actually set the limits.+
* Can a file be big enough to takes days to finish processing?
** +I suppose that anything is possible, however, this is very unlikely. We can do some trials once we have some of this worked out, but I would bet this would be able to process 1000 mice a minute or better.+
* What are the expectations if the import fails, say, half-way through the import?  
** Are the mice partially imported or does the process need to start over?
*** +Yes. The import saves as it goes at this point in its life. If any mouse was successfully imported before the failure then it will be in the database.+
** What is the expectation on the customer?  
*** Do they just upload again?
**** +Colony should log the error to the database and hopefully the user will contact support, so between those two maybe we can find and fix the issue. I suppose that they can try again and if it succeeds then GREAT, but if not, then hopefully they will contact customer service.+
*** If so, will some already be in the system?  
**** +Yes, just as I mentioned earlier.+
*** If so, how will they know which are uploaded and which are not?
**** +They can look at the mouse list for starters. Also, once the mouse import is successful they will be able to download the results of the import in the excel spreadsheet they originally uploaded; it will show which mice imported successfully.+
*** Will we provide a file?
**** +If the Import has a catastrophic failure during processing there will be no file because the process didn't end successfully. The general expectation for the whole site as well as the import is that this will run successfully all of the time and when we see failures in the error log we try and address them. We can specify and code some additional requirements to try and handle this in the best way possible, it just comes down to cost versus benefit.+
* Where will these uploaded files be stored?
** +I don't know what your concern is with this question, but we have already discussed the technical architecture and have decided to store our copy of the files into the database. They will be much easier to keep track of and maintain there.+
* For how long will uploaded files be stored?
** +Good question. This could be decided now or later once we see how much traffic this feature gets.+
* Will the user receive any other notification?
** +Good question. We just need specifications on this. As you know, the existing test UI version doesn't send out any emails, so if we want this version of the UI to send out emails then we need to specify that. Again, we can add that as an additional feature at any time. The user should be able to come back to the site and see what has been uploaded at any time.+",,,,;20/Aug/18 8:46 AM;rwilliams;432000,;20/Aug/18 10:18 AM;admin;600,;29/Aug/18 7:36 AM;rwilliams;57600,,,,,,0,0,490200,"9,223,372,036,854,775,807%",0,0,497400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30/Aug/18 10:14 AM;bwinter;Genotypes for numerous strains in a Group - ImportTemplate-8_30_2018.xlsx;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27534/Genotypes+for+numerous+strains+in+a+Group+-+ImportTemplate-8_30_2018.xlsx,30/Aug/18 9:52 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Download button downloads a XLSX file - 2018-08-30 09_51_46-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27529/PASSED+-+Download+button+downloads+a+XLSX+file+-+2018-08-30+09_51_46-.png,30/Aug/18 9:59 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Download gives more instructions on how to use XLSX file for upload using XLSX cell comments - 2018-08-30 09_54_12-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27531/PASSED+-+Download+gives+more+instructions+on+how+to+use+XLSX+file+for+upload+using+XLSX+cell+comments+-+2018-08-30+09_54_12-.png,30/Aug/18 10:00 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Downloadable XLSX file - ImportTemplate-8_30_2018.xlsx;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27532/PASSED+-+Downloadable+XLSX+file+-+ImportTemplate-8_30_2018.xlsx,"30/Aug/18 9:59 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Downloaded XLSX file has a strains worksheet with grid of all the GROUPs strains with corresponding genes, mutations, and genotypes - 2018-08-30 09_57_08-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27530/PASSED+-+Downloaded+XLSX+file+has+a+strains+worksheet+with+grid+of+all+the+GROUPs+strains+with+corresponding+genes%2C+mutations%2C+and+genotypes+-+2018-08-30+09_57_08-.png","30/Aug/18 9:49 AM;bwinter;PASSED - New UI to download, upload, and view logs - 2018-08-30 09_47_09-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27527/PASSED+-+New+UI+to+download%2C+upload%2C+and+view+logs+-+2018-08-30+09_47_09-.png",30/Aug/18 9:51 AM;bwinter;PASSED - Simple instructions about how to use the new mouse import page - 2018-08-30 09_49_23-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27528/PASSED+-+Simple+instructions+about+how+to+use+the+new+mouse+import+page+-+2018-08-30+09_49_23-.png,31/Jul/18 10:12 AM;rwilliams;Potential UI.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27268/Potential+UI.png,23/Aug/18 12:15 PM;bwinter;REWORK - Download Template throws YSOD - 2018-08-23 10_06_32-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27444/REWORK+-+Download+Template+throws+YSOD+-+2018-08-23+10_06_32-.png,23/Aug/18 12:15 PM;bwinter;REWORK - Upload File throws YSOD - 2018-08-23 10_41_43-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27443/REWORK+-+Upload+File+throws+YSOD+-+2018-08-23+10_41_43-.png,23/Jul/18 10:39 AM;bwinter;UI-sketch - 2018-07-23 10_38_27-Window.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27198/UI-sketch+-+2018-07-23+10_38_27-Window.png,30/Aug/18 10:11 AM;bwinter;Wow-so-cool - 2018-08-30 10_09_16-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27533/Wow-so-cool+-+2018-08-30+10_09_16-.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rwilliams,rwilliams,"{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=6}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":6,""lastUpdated"":""2018-09-04T08:49:14.396-0500"",""stateCount"":6,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""bitbucket"":{""count"":6,""name"":""Bitbucket Cloud""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,,COMA-2656,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,admin,,,Unassigned,cleduc,bwinter,0|i00yzj:,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,YX Connect,2018-08-24 12:45:32.491,"23/Jul/18 10:43 AM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], [~cleduc], here is the story for letting mouse import use XLSX for uploading colony data.

According to documentation, this function pulls the bound data from the grid.  

The problem with this is that the mouse name column, conveniently titled ""Mouse ID"", is bound to the MouseSortName field but displays the MouseName field.

This is important because the bound field is the calculated field which facilitates the proper sorting needed by the grid.  It displays the MouseName field because the MouseName field is what the user uses to identify mice.  So, when the export runs, it pulls the modified name data into the spreadsheet instead of pulling the displayed information.

The KendoGrid documentation explains how to export the viewed data, instead of the bound data here:  https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/data-management/grid/how-to/excel/column-template-export

Edit:
Better link to code with real example: https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/blob/master/grid/column-template-excel/KendoUIMVC5/Views/Home/Index.cshtml

","20/Jul/18 1:31 PM;jjensen;h1. Summary
After a couple of discussions on the subject, and a lot of research, we have discovered that Telerik has not put custom sorting functionality into the Kendo grid extension.  There are two possible directions here:
# Remove the sorting and the export will return to normal
# Rewrite the export

h1.Developer Notes
Rewriting the export is possible if we can determine how the grid is sorting, what columns are visible, and how the data is grouped.  Grouping might be hard-coded as ""by Strain"", which would ease things a bit.  The visible columns can be tracked by spinning through the columns and determining which are not hidden.  It also provides a column ordering.  The sorting can also be gleaned from the grid object, and all of this data can be passed back to the server in parameters via ajax.  The only issue is how we get a server-generated file back out to the client and saved as an Excel file.

h2.Sample Code

{code:java}
    // The grid
    var grid = $(""#MouseGrid"").data(""kendoGrid"");
    // Get the columns shown and in order
    var visibleColumns = new Array();
        for (var idcol = 0; idcol < grid.columns.length; idcol++) {
            if (typeof grid.columns[idcol].hidden === 'undefined') {
                visibleColumns.push(grid.columns[idcol].field);
            }
        }
    // Determine the sort criteria
    var sortCriteria = grid.dataSource._sort();

","31/Jul/18 4:00 PM;jcox;[~bwinter], [~jjensen], [~cleduc], COMA-2589 was the only one that Carrie and I noticed.  It was in Unplanned so we moved it into 1.2 this afternoon.","03/Aug/18 4:29 PM;jjensen;[~bwinter], I have pushed this to Review and have created a pull request.  However, I am not sure what to do with the linked item COMA-2589.  Any suggestions?","06/Aug/18 8:04 AM;bwinter;[~jjensen], leave the linked item as is.  COMA-2589 sort of gets pulled along with this ticket.  During the next push to QA, I will test both tickets.  If COMA-2589 doesn't pass for some reason, we will just put it back to UNPLANNED.  But if it passes, then we get it ""off the books""!  

This is more or less for ""bookkeeping"" thing in JIRA.  ",14/Aug/18 11:54 AM;cleduc;[~bwinter] [~jcox] Do we know roughly when we can push to production on this ticket?,"14/Aug/18 12:57 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], I am the bottle neck.  [~rwilliams] mentioned to me late last week that this ticket is ready for QA.  I think we can start testing it this week.  I will have better update tomorrow during Stand-up.  This is on my radar now though.

CC: [~jcox], [~jmedlock], [~wwyatt]","14/Aug/18 1:03 PM;jcox;[~rwilliams], Could you move this through the statuses to show that it's ready for QA?  I think it may also ask for your time spent.

cc: [~bwinter], [~cleduc]","14/Aug/18 1:15 PM;rwilliams;[~jcox] [~bwinter] [~cleduc] This ticket is not in QA yet. It is ready to be moved into QA, but it didn't make it in the last round and I assumed it would go with the next batch of tickets after the current batch is tested and deployed to Staging and Production. If you want it merged in with the current batch, let me know, but it will add to the testing time and will thus further delay the current batch.","14/Aug/18 3:18 PM;cleduc;[~rwilliams][~jcox][~bwinter] We've had several customers report in to customer service now about this so we really need it fast - as a fix to a bug. But, I get that it ended up attached to the whole cage view business. If we can do it ahead of something else, great, if not, not. An estimate would be very valuable though.  ","14/Aug/18 8:23 PM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] [~bwinter] [~jcox] Carrie, I think you make the call on what to do, but understand that we currently have a set of tickets in QA that are still in the process of being tested. If we add this ticket to the current batch it will add to the testing that will need to be completed before we can move this batch to production. You should probably talk to Bryan about the time required for testing. We could consider a hot fix of this ticket and leap frog the current batch of tickets in QA, however, this ticket will still need to get tested AND since we are so close to having the current batch of tickets tested and ready to move forward, it probably makes more sense to go ahead and include this ticket to the current batch and delay it a little for the additional testing. That's my $0.02.","15/Aug/18 8:24 AM;cleduc;Thanks [~rwilliams] - That's find to put it next in line. [~bwinter] and [~jcox] can we roughly estimate timeline on the tickets in process now and then this ticket?
","15/Aug/18 8:27 AM;bwinter;[~cleduc] We sure can.  I just emailed you a timeline CC'ing [~rwilliams], [~jcox], and others.","15/Aug/18 8:31 AM;jcox;[~cleduc], We currently have 3 bugs and 1 story in the ""ready to release"" status as well as 1 more bug ticket in QA.  I intended to bring that up in today's standup by asking if this means a deployment can happen within the next day or so.  If that's the case, then I think we may have time to get this ticket QA'd as well by the end of week and possibly have another deployment ready for this weekend, but that's just a guess.

[~rwilliams], I agree with everything you wrote in your comment.  Adding this ticket to the current batch wouldn't guarantee that it would go into production sooner, but it would guarantee the current ""ready to release"" tickets would go in later.  What can we do to ensure this fix is deployed as soon as possible?

CC: [~bwinter]","15/Aug/18 8:34 AM;jcox;[~cleduc][~bwinter][~rwilliams], Please disregard previous comment... Bryan has proposed a plan via email...

Proposed Plan
1.	Bryan tests last ticket today (Aug 15)
2.	Rich or Chris push release to PROD (Aug 15 after 7 PM)
3.	Rich or Chris push Jamie’s bug fix to QA (Aug 15 after 7 PM)
4.	Bryan and Wes test fix tomorrow (Aug 16)
5.	Rich or Chris push fix to PROD (Aug 16 after 7 PM)
 
","15/Aug/18 11:38 AM;cleduc;[~jcox][~bwinter][~rwilliams] Thanks everyone, I just reviewed the tickets going out and since they are all bug fix or improvement tickets which I haven't had customer reports on so I will just combine those release notes with what I do when the export ticket goes out. -one less batch of notes. ","16/Aug/18 11:14 AM;jjensen;Error found during QA: NULL value causes code explosion when filters are cleared and the export is run.  Fixed by ensuring a simple truth value (""0=0"") was present for the WHERE clause.  Also discovered a nasty issue when selecting certain genotypes as filters--IIS would die most horribly as it complained about ""<sup>"" text in the genotype (superscripting), warning about universe-eroding security breaches and so forth.  So, I added a small decorator on the controller method to _ignore_ this warning.  'Nuff said.","17/Aug/18 9:16 AM;jjensen;[~bwinter] found another issue in QA:  Selecting a column to display, followed immediately by adding another item in the Status filter causes the auto-generated search filter to generate an empty SQL clause, generating an invalid sql statement error.  The act of adding a column causes the Kendo grid to generate a filter item which basically says ""find rows where FIELD contains SEARCHTEXT"" for each visible field.  Since the search text is blank, the condition will always match everything.  It's a CYA move on the part of the grid, but it causes odd syntax if left alone.  The code originally just blanked this out, and the initial testing did not reveal this problem, but Bryan found a very specific condition which did break it, so I just changed the empty return text from the GenerateSqlCondition method to the standard truth statement: ""0=0"".  Fixed.  FYI [~cleduc]","17/Aug/18 1:10 PM;bwinter;Great job, [~jjensen]!  Testing passed!  Thank you for writing this piece of code!  Our customers are going to be better for it!",,,,,,

Here is that documentation copied from the proc.

{code:sql}
-- =============================================
-- Author:		Rich Williams
-- Create date: 8/22/2018
-- Description:	Use this stored procedure to create a brand new group with Strain-related data based on an 
-- existing group. You will pass in an existing group's Id and an existing user's Id and this proc will
-- create a new group, add the passed in user as the leader of the group and add that user into the group. 
-- This proc will also copy all non-deleted strain related data from the existing group and set it up as part of
-- the newly created group. This proc can be useful for quickly duplicating a group and strain information
-- without bringing in the other data. Strain-related data includes strain, genes, alleles (mutations),
-- and gene results along with some other required data. The new group will not be tied to the existiing
-- group in any way, except that the strain-related data will be setup to be an exact copy of the other.

-- Parameters
--		@groupIdToCopy - specify the group id (guid) for the group you want to copy
--		@newGroupName - specify the name you want the new group to have
--		@newGroupLeaderUserId - specify the user id (guid) for the user you want to be the leader of the
--			group as well as to be the first member of the group

-- Example: EXEC dbo.Tech_CopyGroupAndStrainRelatedData '5b292026-9cc8-4943-913d-b52bc29dbd0f', 'Test Group Copy!', 'B65302E9-4815-4854-9BFB-47E1A7DB3930',

{code:sql}
-- =============================================
-- Author:		Rich Williams
-- Create date: 7/29/2018
-- Description:	Use this stored procedure to either delete some or all of a Colony group's data 
-- or delete the whole group and all of its data. If you chose to not delete the group's strain related
-- data or the group's cage related data or to not delete the group and its users, then the script will 
-- leave the group and its existing users intact. Therefore, to delete the entire group, the group's 
-- users included, then you must pass a true (1) for all three parameters @deleteStrainRelatedData, 
-- @deleteCageRelatedData and @deleteGroupAndUsers

-- Parameters
--		@groupId - pass in the group id (guid) for the group you want to process for
--		@deleteStrainRelatedData - specify if you want to delete or leave intact the group's strain related data
--			- Strain related data = Strains, StrainGenes, Genes, StrainGeneAlleles, GeneResults
--			- pass in 1 if you want to delete Strain related data
--			- pass in 0 if you want to leave the Strain related intact
--		@deleteCageRelatedData - specify if you want to delete or leave intact the group's cage related data
--			- Cage related data = Cages, CageClaims, Racks and Rooms
--			- pass in 1 if you want to delete Cage related data
--			- pass in 0 if you want to leave the Cage related intact
--		@deleteGroupAndUsers bit - specify if you want to actually delete the group and its users
--			- pass in 1 if you want to actually delete the group and its users
--			- pass in 0 if you want to leave the group and its users intact
--		@actuallyDeleteTheData bit - specify if you want to do a test run of the delete or execute the delete 
--			- pass in 1 if you want to actually execute the delete
--			- pass in 0 if you want to do a test run of the delete

-- Example: EXEC dbo.Tech_DeleteGroupData '3af194fc-3502-40fc-8b61-2d5e5ab91f7e', 0, 0, 0, 0
-- Example: EXEC dbo.Tech_DeleteGroupData '10000000-1000-1000-1000-100000000000', 1, 0, 0, 0

# Select a strain > go to strain dashboard
# Manually create a new mutation for that strain (do NOT create via MGI ID)
# Manually create a new gene
# Go to Gene Mutations List

h1. What I expected to happen:

When I move a mutation from a gene, I expect the gene card to always show.

h1. DEV Note

I have found the bug, or maybe “feature” as it may be better called. I forgot that the system allowed a user to do this, but a Gene Mutation can be edited and in that edit they can change the Gene that a mutation is associated with it. The problem MUST be that it DOESN’T clean up the GeneResults that were associated with it PREVIOUS Gene. This is bad. It should at a minimum mark them as deleted so that we can treat them as such. I guess we need a bug ticket and some direction on priority to get this fixed. This is all of a sudden causing a problem because of the new code that I added to the GeneResult that allows it to calculate its own SysGenTranslatedResult and it own Shorthand name. That code picks up these GeneResults and looks up the Gene and Allele information for the GeneResult but if cannot find it in the system, and it is because it has been MOVED!! 

We need to look at Transgene scenarios and see if there are any implications with those as well.",,,,;27/Jul/18 10:37 AM;rwilliams;86400,;27/Jul/18 2:33 PM;rwilliams;300,;03/Aug/18 9:50 AM;admin;300,;15/Aug/18 5:37 PM;bwinter;7200,;16/Aug/18 9:02 AM;rwilliams;300,;16/Aug/18 9:09 AM;jcox;300,,,,0,94800,,,0,94800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15/Aug/18 5:11 PM;bwinter;BUG - Moving mutation from one gene to another causes Gene Card to go blank - 2018-08-15 17_07_19-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27379/BUG+-+Moving+mutation+from+one+gene+to+another+causes+Gene+Card+to+go+blank+-+2018-08-15+17_07_19-.png,19/Jul/18 5:16 PM;bwinter;Moving mutations across genes causes problems in gene cards - 2018-07-17.msg;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27188/Moving+mutations+across+genes+causes+problems+in+gene+cards+-+2018-07-17.msg,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - move transgene allele back to a transgene works as expected - must be a new transgene though - 2018-08-15 17_26_17-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27385/PASSED+-+move+transgene+allele+back+to+a+transgene+works+as+expected+-+must+be+a+new+transgene+though+-+2018-08-15+17_26_17-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving a mutation to a new gene updates the gene card for all strains with that mutation - 2018-08-15 17_34_49-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27386/PASSED+-+moving+a+mutation+to+a+new+gene+updates+the+gene+card+for+all+strains+with+that+mutation+-+2018-08-15+17_34_49-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving a transgene allele (why is this a thing) to a non-transgene is allowed - 2018-08-15 17_23_55-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27383/PASSED+-+moving+a+transgene+allele+%28why+is+this+a+thing%29+to+a+non-transgene+is+allowed+-+2018-08-15+17_23_55-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving multiple mutations to a gene works as expected - 2018-08-15 17_20_07-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27381/PASSED+-+moving+multiple+mutations+to+a+gene+works+as+expected+-+2018-08-15+17_20_07-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving mutation to a gene created from MGI search updates gene cards as expected - 2018-08-15 17_17_23-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27382/PASSED+-+moving+mutation+to+a+gene+created+from+MGI+search+updates+gene+cards+as+expected+-+2018-08-15+17_17_23-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving mutation to a manually created gene works as expected - 2018-08-15 17_28_19-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27384/PASSED+-+moving+mutation+to+a+manually+created+gene+works+as+expected+-+2018-08-15+17_28_19-.png,15/Aug/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;PASSED - moving strain from MGI created gene back to manually created gene works as expected - 2018-08-15 17_18_14-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/27380/PASSED+-+moving+strain+from+MGI+created+gene+back+to+manually+created+gene+works+as+expected+-+2018-08-15+17_18_14-.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jcox,rwilliams,"{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2018-08-03T11:22:58.591-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""bitbucket"":{""count"":1,""name"":""Bitbucket Cloud""}}}}},""isStale"":false}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,admin,,,Unassigned,,bwinter,0|i00yv3:,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,YX Connect,2018-07-18 13:42:46.953,"18/Jul/18 8:31 AM;rwilliams;[~jcox]  I don’t know what the process is for new bugs but I created this ticket and I plan on working on it today.

This has to do with the feature that allows users to change the Gene that a Gene Mutation is associated with. Unfortunately it appears that this feature makes no attempt to clean up the already associated GeneResults when it moves the allele to the next Gene and that causes it to leave behind GeneResults that are associated with Alleles that are no longer associated with the Genes that the GeneResults belong to. Bad news, bad data!! I sent a email with more details, but I think we need another ticket for that issue and some priority to get that fixed.

Cage map filter does not match results from Cage bar graph or iOS Cage Map filter,COMA-2627,29357,,Bug,Production,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,Done,,bwinter,bwinter,25/Jun/18 3:50 PM,16/Aug/18 9:09 AM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,16/Aug/18 9:09 AM,,CM - Release 1.2,,,0,,,,,,,,"bq. Several issues were causing the problem of the dashboard cages panel bar chart count to NOT match the Cage Map filter.  [~rwilliams] fixed a few.  This ticket has been updated to fix another one found during testing.  The Investigation section below outlines the original description of this ticket.

h1. What happened:

# Go to Dashboard
# Hover over the one-mouse-per-cage bar in Cage bar graph panel > Tool tip should say ""1 Mouse (X)""
# Note the number in parentheses ""(X)"".
# Add a litter to a breeding
# Let the litter count be 1 pup
# ID, Biopsy, and wean litter just created
# Place weaned pup in a new cage
# Place cage in a room on a rack
# Note the Cage ID, Rack Name, and RoomName
# Go to Dashboard > Cages Panel > Cage bar graph > hover over one-mouse-per-cage bar with Tool Tip ""1 Mouse (Y)""
# The actions taken above incremented the count of cage with just one mouse <- {color:#14892c}EXPECTED{color}
# Note that Y = X+1, where X was the original number <- {color:#14892c}EXPECTED{color}
# Go back to the litter and delete it > Litters List > find litter > View Litter > Litter 3-dot menu > Delete litter 
# Go back to weaned pups cage
# Note weaned pup has been deleted and no longer shows in cage <- {color:#14892c}EXPECTED (for now){color}
# Filter Cage Map by Singly Housed mice
# Note that empty cage that previously housed weaned pup is not selected <- {color:#14892c}EXPECTED{color}
# Go to Dashboard > Cages Panel > Cage bar graph > hover over bar with Tool Tip ""1 Mouse (Y)""
# Note that Y is still equal to X+1 <- {color:#d04437}UNEXPECTED{color}

h1. What I expected to happen:

* I expected the one-mouse-per-cage bar in the Cages panel to equal the original starting number X.
* I expected the Z-mice-per-cage counts in the bar graph to match the number of cages selected from the Cage Map's Z-mice-per-cage Filter.

h1. Investigation

bq. This ticket started out as an investigation to figure out why the bar graph in the cages panel on the dashboard does not match the Cage Map filter.  [~rwilliams] has done a great job investigating this pernicious problem.  See comments below.  {color:#f79232}The _What happened_ section below should NOT be used to test this ticket further.{color} It is only included for historical purposes.

* *Note 1* - *_Cage Graph_* and *_iOS Cage Map Filter_* do NOT count these cages as only having 1 mouse
## _Room_ MCB-208 > *_Rack_ 1* > _Position_ *D4*
*** iOS Cage Map filter shows 3 mice in Cage
*** Web Cage Map filter shows 1 mouse in Cage
*** _DB - there are 3 mice in the cage, but only 1 is weaned and the cage should only show weaned mice. There is a litter in the cage as well for the unweaned mice, but that litter was deleted._
## _Room_ MCB-208 > *_Rack_ 1* > _Position_ *B9*
*** iOS Cage Map filter shows 1 breeder with active litter of ten 20-week old, unweaned pups mice in Cage
*** Web Cage Map filter shows 1 retired breeder (broken heart) with active litter of seven 20-week, weaned pups in Cage
*** _DB - There are 8 mice in the cage, but only 1 is weaned. There is a litter in the cage as well that the other 7 mice belong to._
* *Note 2* - *_Cage Graph_* and *_iOS Cage Map Filter_* do NOT count these cages as only having 2 mice
## _Room_ MCB-208 > *_Rack_ 1* > _Position_ *B2*
*** iOS Cage Map filter shows 3 mice in Cage
*** Web Cage Map filter shows 2 mice in Cage
*** _DB - There are 3 mice in that cage. None of them are weaned, however, only 1 of the 3 are associated with a litter. So that is part of the logic as well for displaying mice in a cage - if the mouse is associated with a litter, only show it in the cage if it is weaned, else show the mouse regardless of weaned status. There are 4 litters in that cage, 1 is deleted and the other 3 are weaned, therefore none of them show in the cage._
## _Room_ MCB-208 > *_Rack_ 1* > _Position_ *A5*
*** iOS Cage Map filter shows 6+ mice in Cage
*** _DB - This cage has 19 mice in it. None of the mice have wean dates, but 2 of the mice are not associated with a litter. There are 7 litters in that cage, 1 is deleted, 1 is weaned._
## _Room_ MCB-208 > _*Rack_ 2* > _Position_ *A5*
*** iOS Cage Map filter shows 6+ mice in Cage
*** DB - The cage has 14 mice, 0 are weaned, 2 are not part of a litter. There are 4 litters, 3 are weaned.
* *Note 3* - *_Cage Graph_* and *_iOS Cage Map Filter_* do NOT count these cages as only having 3 mice
## _Room_ MCB-208 > *_Rack_ 2* > _Position_ *G3*

This ticket deals with mice per cage counts discrepancies: 
So the first thing I have found, and this may be THE issue with the rest of the cage mice count issues, is that there are mice in cages that are part of a litter, but the mice have never been weaned and the litter has been deleted. I am doing some educated assuming here but, on the web I don't think that the cage shows (or includes in counts) non-weaned mice because the assumption is that they are still considered to be part of a litter. Also, on the web, the Cage normally displays a litter when it is associated with a cage, however, in this case, the Litter has been deleted, so it isn't being shown in the cage view for that reason. I guess the question becomes, how do we deal with this issue? Should we have marked any unweaned mice as deleted when the litter was deleted? I would assume that there is no cascading deletion  like that being done today, but is that what we need to do to resolve this? Or another option might be that when a litter is deleted we mark any pups as weaned immediately? Or do we need to calculate the mice per cage count differently and change what mice get displayed in a cage, so that, if there are unweaned mice who are in a deleted litter, that we go ahead and include them in the cage and in the count. That to me sounds like the yuckiest solution.

This first cage I looked at (first in the list in the ticket above), it really does have 3 mice in the cage (and it looks like iOS shows all 3 mice in the cage there), but 2 are not weaned and belong to a deleted litter which is also associated with the same cage, but doesn't show because it is deleted

Looking at the second cage listed in the ticket, the one at position B9 , has 8 mice but 7 are not weaned and are part of the same litter, the litter that is listed in the cage. The litter pup count discrepancy between iOS and the web is an issue on the iOS side with the calculation of pups. On the litter is recorded the PupCountAtBirth of 10 with a MissingCount of 3. I believe that iOS is showing the PupCountAtBirth and not considering the Missing or the FoundDeadCount, etc. On the web, we actually calculate the pup count whenever we load the litter. If the pups haven't been generated we use the litter fields to determine count, but as soon as the pups are generated we actually look at the actual mice in the system to determine the number of pups.","11/Jul/18 10:19 AM;cleduc;[~rwilliams] [~bwinter][~jmedlock] [~jstrickland] This sounds like we maybe worked off different users particular needs in the different apps, and users also maybe made some errors between ""dead"" vs. ""deleted"". 
What if it did this in both systems:
* Animal records are created when litter counts are entered or not but it should be the same in both systems if possible. Then how we include exclude animals in counts would be same in both as well. 
* If pup records are created prior to wean and appear in the mouse list, the user just needs to know so that they can consider age in their record searching.
* Delete litter throws question: would you like to mark all pups dead or delete record of the pups? If a litter is deleted this must be resolved. 
* Animals per cage = Adults (weaned) including breeders  - I say this as the animals per cage is used primarily to see cages that have too many adult mice that need to be recaged, and/or cages that can be consolidated. 
* Two pup counts have value: Pups born = total recorded born, Pups weaned = pups born minus the missing, found dead, and euthanized prior to wean. 




","11/Jul/18 12:37 PM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] Here are my responses to your earlier comments: 

*Note:* I did some additional research into some of the specific scenarios mentioned in the ticket and I added my findings to the description in the ticket. While doing this I realized that there is a little more logic for the displaying of mice in cages. If a mouse is not associated with a litter (meaning that it was manually added to colony via ""add mice""), then it will show in the cage (if it isn't deleted or dead, etc.). If the mouse is from a litter then it will only show in the cage if it is weaned.

* Animal records are created when litter counts are entered or not but it should be the same in both systems if possible. Then how we include exclude animals in counts would be same in both as well.
** My response: Agree. In the web, mice/pups for a litter are created via the litter workbench at the specific time that that user clicks the ""Save and Generate"" button. This is done before the mice are IDed, Biopsied or Weaned.  Once the mice are generated they are viewable in the MiceList, however, in the Cage view, the unweaned litter is displayed and the unweaned mice are NOT displayed (unless the mouse is not associated with a litter, then it is displayed regardless of its weaned state).
* If pup records are created prior to wean and appear in the mouse list, the user just needs to know so that they can consider age in their record searching.
** My response: I don't have issues with this, but I don't know how we communicate that to users. The Mouse List has a default filter that shows alive mice.
* Delete litter throws question: would you like to mark all pups dead or delete record of the pups? If a litter is deleted this must be resolved.
** My response: Do we need a ticket for this or do we use this ticket to do that? I lean toward a specific ticket to implement that functionality. I think we need to identify all of the places where litters can be deleted to make sure that they all use the same logic.
* Animals per cage = Adults (weaned) including breeders - I say this as the animals per cage is used primarily to see cages that have too many adult mice that need to be recaged, and/or cages that can be consolidated.
** My response: This is the case with the web app, however, it appears that the iOS app may not be excluding non-weaned mice (or maybe it is doing something else), see Note 1 above.
* Two pup counts have value: Pups born = total recorded born, Pups weaned = pups born minus the missing, found dead, and euthanized prior to wean.

I've been doing a little more looking into this issue. I am seeing 2 issues so far.

* 1. We need to change the way that the application (web and iOS) handles the deletion of a litter. I think we need to write this up as its own ticket. I don't know how often this happens, but when it does it will potentially throw off counts and mice will get lost in cages (if the mice were not weaned prior to the deletion of the litter). The mice are still able to be found in the mouse list, but not in the cages. Possible options for what happens when a litter is deleted:
** Delete all of the associated pups
** Mark dead all of the associated pups
** Disassociate all of the associated pups from the litter (we have logic in the cage card view that only shows weaned pups if they are associated with a litter, if they are not associated with a litter we show them)
** I don't think this is a good option, but we leave the pups associated with the litter, but mark them all as weaned. That way they would show up in the cage.
** Another possibly silly option would be to only allow the litter to be deleted is if NO pups have been generated OR if the litter as a whole has been weaned (all alive pups are weaned).
* 2. We have logic that is applied to which mice show in a cage on the cage card view, however we do not have that same logic applied to the mice counts that are displayed on the dashboard page. I am correcting this issue with this ticket. I have also shared the logic with [~jstrickland] for the iOS side (I'm not sure if the iOS needs any changes to be made).

cc: [~bwinter] [~jmedlock]","13/Jul/18 8:53 AM;cleduc;[~rwilliams] [~jmedlock] Agree on the ticket writing and thank you for making things consistent. Once they are consistent we can train users how to find the count they need. 

On the ticket: My inclination is to keep the user from doing this. Our users struggle with understanding the difference between a record and a physical mouse.
How about this:
When a user attempts to delete a litter they are prompted with a selection something like:
What would you like to do with the pups:
* Delete the record of this litter and delete associated pup records and resulting empty cages
* Keep the record of this litter and mark all pups as dead, deleting the resulting empty cages
* Delete the record of this litter and reassign pups to new cages (I have no idea why this would happen though)
I'm sure I missed things here. I'll review further. ","14/Jul/18 12:00 PM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] I agree with you for the most part. I personally don't think we need to give them the option to move the mice to other cages simply because its adds complexity to the simple process of deleting the litter especially if you don't see that as a normal choice. I agree with making the options very clear. We can even add something like ""If you choose to delete the pups, this will remove them completely from the history of your colony, as opposed to if you choose to mark the pups as dead, Colony will retain the information on these pups as part of the history of your colony."" Who ever works on the ticket will need to be cautious when it comes to deleting the cage. What I mean by that is that they will need to make sure that the cage is empty before deleting it. I could see it where the mom is still in the cage with the pups and deleting the litter and the pups shouldn't delete the mom, so in a case like this we shouldn't delete the cage either. I add that more as a note to the developer that picks up this new ticket.","18/Jul/18 4:18 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], [~rwilliams], after thinking about this problem and doing some research, I realized that the following table might be helpful in summarizing what should happen.  What do you think?

h1. Inputs at Issue

I see that the inputs at issue are 

* Pups at birth ( 0 or more than 0)
* Number of offspring (0 if no records generated, some count otherwise)
* At least one offspring in a breeding? (yes or no)

h1. Actions to Take

From the table below, I see 3 possible actions:

# Do not allow user to delete litter record
# Notify user that litter has offspring records, and those need to be deleted first. Give user screen to delete all. 
# Delete litter record - no consequence


h1. Table of Inputs and Actions

|| Pups at birth || Number of offspring || At least one offspring in a breeding? || Action to take ||
| 1 or more | 1 or more | Yes | Do not allow user to delete litter record |

h1. Notes

* {color:#f79232}Pups at birth can be 0 and offspring more than zero if user selects, say 5 pups at birth when creating litter, then takes action that creates offspring records, then edits litter count at birth to 0 and saves.{color}
* {color:#f691b2}Offspring can be 0 and in a breeding if user deletes mouse through inactive litter card after adding them to a breeding.

","18/Jul/18 4:33 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] I really like where you are going and I need to sit and read through it all, however, I just wanted to mention this: in code, PupCountAtBirth means nothing once mice are generated. Once a litter has offspring, then we shouldn't consider the PupCountAtBirth any longer. I would add, that if a litter has no offspring, regardless of how many pups at birth, then deleting the litter is fine. This disagrees with your suggestion in your table, but in this case there have been no mice generated and therefore there is no reason to be concerned about deleting the litter.

Question regarding your table, 2nd row, 3rd column - ""At least one offspring in a breeding?"", what does ""no"" mean there? In fact, what does breeding have to do with this conversation?","18/Jul/18 4:42 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams] Great point! After thinking about your column, I noticed that that first column for pups at birth is actually redundant anyway.  If you remove it, the action to take remains the same.  The action to take is really dependent on number of offspring and whether at least one of them is in a breeding.","18/Jul/18 5:06 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] So I am not sure why you thought to bring breedings into this discussion, but I think I understand your concern. Basically we may not be able to just ""delete all mice in the litter"" because some of these mice may be employed in other tasks in the Colony. Wow. There is so much to think about!! But, based on this thought I say we allow any litter to be deleted if 1) it has no offspring, or 2) if all of it's offspring are dead, deleted or transferred. Therefore, if they really really want to delete a litter, and if there are offspring, then the user has to go through the system and find the offspring and delete them where they are. Let the rules for deletion of the mouse be employed in the context of the the mouse instead of in the context of the litter. Basically we can let the user click the delete button on any litter, but if there are any offspring that is not deleted, dead or transferred, then we tell the user that the litter cannot be deleted until all of it's offspring have been deleted, marked dead or transferred. If there are no offspring, or if they are all deleted, marked dead or transferred, then we go ahead and delete the litter. That makes this nice and simple. I almost feel like we should take out the ""marked dead"" option and I think that all mice should be deleted or transferred. If they are marked dead but they are tied to a litter, I would think that we would want the history, the data, that the mouse was tied to that litter. But, honestly, we aren't really hard deleting anything so the deleted mouse and the deleted litter would still be there in the system, but just not seen by the user.
CC: [~cleduc]","18/Jul/18 5:19 PM;cleduc;[~rwilliams][~bwinter] - I want to make them go delete the pups if they want to delete the litter or the breeding. Marking dead and transferred still means they were real, and alive. If creation of the litter or breeding was an error, they need to go through the trouble of deleting the animals associated and recreating the correct litter or breeding, creating new pups in those and doing whatever they need to to make those animals correct. 
They can delete but they need to delete associated animals. I'm OK with that. 
The only short cut they will want is to reattach to a different litter or breeding but we can get fancy later. ","23/Jul/18 11:44 AM;bwinter;[~rwilliams] and [~cleduc], I am agreement with both of you, and I was trying to capture those ideas in a truth table in my comment from last week (July 19):

User wants to delete litter 
* if no offspring ever created, then let them delete litter record
* if offspring created, then check for offspring in a breeding
** if no offspring in a breeding, then ask them what to do with offspring of the litter
** if at least one offspring in a breeding, then do not allow deletion of record","23/Jul/18 11:52 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] [~cleduc]  To keep this simple I still say that we make the user go and delete the mice associated with the litter before they can delete the litter. This keeps the delete litter process nice and simple.  
","23/Jul/18 11:55 AM;cleduc;[~bwinter][~rwilliams] Agree. To delete this litter record, you must first delete the animals associated. ...or something like that..",25/Jul/18 4:16 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams] is this ticket testable in QA?,"25/Jul/18 7:08 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter]  Testing May be difficult because we have data issues. I.e. live unweaned mice that belong to deleted litters. We need another ticket to fix the delete litter functionality and we need to take a little time to “fix” the bad data by either undeleting the litter or deleting mice of a deleted litter (ha).  
","31/Jul/18 9:05 AM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], thank you for talking to me about this ticket yesterday.  Can you take a second and let me know if I have everything written correctly?

* This issue affects all environments for customers who have deleted litters with generated mice. We will need to discuss how to deal with this issue because right now there is a possibility that some counts are off because of the data. We can discuss this as part of the ticket that fixes deleting litters.","01/Aug/18 3:22 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] [~cleduc] Based on Bryan's recent testing we found that the application is deleting pups on a litter when the litter is deleted. I verified in the code that the ""delete litter"" menu option on both 1) a litter in a cage card and 2) the litter in the litter card are calling the same code on the server side (LitterController.DeleteLitter) and that code cascades the delete to the mice in the pup. In fact, it also marks litter parents deleted and the offspring settings as well. Now, are there any other places in the application that you can think of where a litter can be deleted? Ohhhhh, one place is likely the iOS app. We need to check that...

I just checked in with [~jstrickland] with regard to the iOS and he says that the iOS application works the same way as far as cascading the delete to the mice, parents and offspring settings. So this relly leaves me scratching my head. Maybe we are looking at old data, but I won't know until I look at it again.

Last note, none of these delete litter functions throws up a warning to the user about deleting the pups, it just does it!

One more note: The more you know... I just ran a query in staging for the Wilkerson lab to look at litters that were deleted with mice that weren't deleted. After looking at the data like this I can see that these litters were deleted outside of the application, probably because of bad data. So all of this around deleted litters with no deleted mice and it appears that probably picked a poor data set to do our initial investigation on. I also ran this query on production to see if there were any deleted litters with non-deleted pups and there are ZERO cases. I attached an image of the data from Staging where you can see that these litters all show a deleted date of '2000-01-01 00:00:00.000'.

[~bwinter] Based on that last bit of information we may have totally fixed the count issues, however, to really know that we probably need to look at a better set of data. If you want to stick with this data, why don't you let me mark all of these pups as deleted and then let's check it again.

","11/Jul/18 10:01 AM;jjensen;Bryan:

For Breeding 41, the litter associated with the parents is marked as Inactive via the logic in the Litters business object.  Here is what it does.  A litter is considered inactive when:

  1.  The DeletedDate is null, and
  2.  The WeanedDate is null and
  3.  There is at least one surviving mouse or pup.

Breeding 41’s parents were associated with a litter that had the WeanedDate set.  As such, it was marked ‘Inactive’ and thus the parents had no ‘active’ litters.

I think the rest of the breedings you tested will show one of the three tests listed above as false.

So, the question is this:  Is the current method of determining the active status of a litter accurate?

I spoke briefly with other devs and it seems that there may be an issue with the WeanedDate.  Specifically, we were unsure if the WeanedDate on a litter was an accurate representation of the pups’ actual weaned status, or perhaps the check should be with the WeanedDate on each individual mouse in the litter.

I am leaning toward checking each mouse, but I don’t have or cannot find any pre-existing code which determines a litter’s status based on weaned information.

Also, this is the only item holding up the code release.

I look forward to your judgement on this issue.

Given how much the lab-side may the Gene Cards to determine number of mice with particular genotype, this ticket might be a higher priority if it is a quick fix.

[~cleduc], [~jcox], I have placed this ticket in Unplanned at the moment, but raised its priority to Important.","19/Jun/18 8:45 AM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], would you mind testing something on your machine?  Does resizing your browser zoom change whether or not you can see the Gene Card info.  I stumbled across it yesterday and noticed noticed that I can see (not see) the Gene Cards for these Zoom percentages:

* Any presets above 100% is *blank*
* 100% is visible
* 90% is *blank*
* 75%, 80% is visible
* Any presets below 67% is *blank*

It doesn't happen to everyone.  And we don't know why yet.","20/Jun/18 2:26 PM;admin;[~jjensen] [~cleduc]

In addition to the weirdness described above, there are other instances where a gene card will simply not show up (inconsistent between page loads). Lets approach this with an eye to making sure that the gene cards are 100% visible any time they are present.","20/Jun/18 4:37 PM;jjensen;[~admin], [~bwinter]  Okay, so when I change the zoom in the browser to 90%, for example, the cards all show blank.  But, a refresh with F5 brings all the data back.  A quick look through the interwebs shows that Chrome has had several font and display-related issues with text and borders as far back as version 34 and up until the present.  

I believe the zooming issue belongs to the Chrome development team, is outside of our scope, and can be resolved with an F5 redraw.  In other words, a non-issue.

The missing gene cards may have some relationship to css attributes, but I doubt this, and I have yet not been able to see this in action.  Ergo, I cannot do much about that ""problem"" if it cannot be reproduced.  Nonetheless, I will keep trying.

[~cleduc], Finally, there was a sense that this issue is related to a problem found at UCLA when attempting to select mutations in a drop-down list for a new strain that do not appear.  This is a completely different problem.  If there is a ticket which addresses the missing mutations in the drop-down list, please let me know.",20/Jun/18 5:17 PM;cleduc;[~jjensen] [~admin] I think Chris felt these were related and so tacked on to here.

While at UCLA, [~jmedlock] messaged [~rjonakin] about an issue concerning users getting a ""Whoops!"" error on the Cage Workbench after [~jmedlock] performed the _change-the-strain-for-a-mouse_ trick (see below) for a mice assigned to the wrong strain.  [~rjonakin] investigated the issue and discovered the solution, which he hot fixed into Production last week (sometime between June 5th and June 7th).  This card was created to insert those changes in QA so that QA matches Prod.

h1. Change the Strain of a Mouse Trick
When you want to change the strain of mouse, one can perform this trick, although {color:red}this trick is *NOT recommended* at all{color}!

# Go to the strain dashboard for the strain you want for the mouse
# Copy the strain GUID from the URL starting immediately after snippet {{.../Strain/Dashboard?strainId=}}.
# Find the mouse whose strain you want to change
# Navigate to Edit Mouse modal for that Mouse
# With Edit Mouse modal open, right-click on Strain Name in upper-left corner > Select Inspect Element (in Chrome) > Opens DevTools
# Expand {{div class}} for Strain Name element
# Double-click on {{value}} property
# Replace StrainID GUID with GUID copied above
# Click elsewhere in the Elements Console to save change
# Click Save in Edit Mouse Modal

h1. What happened

# Perform _change-the-strain-for-a-mouse_ trick for a mouse in a cage
# Move cage to Staging Area > Click View in Workbench
# ""Whoops! ..."" error thrown <- {color:red}UNEXPECTED?{color}

h1. What I expected to happen

* *This is weird to say*, but I expected no Whoops! error to be thrown and for the Cage Workbench to display like normal.  This is weird to say because I performed _change-the-strain-for-a-mouse_ trick for a mouse, which I should not be doing in the first place.  
* Nonetheless, this trick was done to help out some customers (in the absence of no formal way to change strain of a mouse), and [~jmedlock] needed the Workbench to work as expected after performing the trick.

h1. Info

Same bug as the cage map had when displaying the cage cards. The Strain Object for the Litters in the cages IS NULL.

This code can be fixed in the getter for cages, it is not explicitly declaring the need for Litter.Strain from the mapping service.

There are, however, a few issues.

# At this time, only the action icons have been moved up, away from the grid, and into the ActionBar.  It looks like the search input box can move there as well, and it can be made list-agnostic in case the impetus for exploring the relocation of the search bar is to make it more generic.
# When I resize the window to a tablet or phone format, the positioning of the ActionBar icon containers does crazy things.  Please look at the attached pictures for details.  Two specific problems can be seen:
## The ActionBar container does not change in height when the icons stack vertically, and
## The wide container in the mouse list eventually wraps and makes this page look extremely bad.
# Spacing between icons may become an issue when usability problems arise with tablet form factor testing.

 !Screen Shot 06-15-18 at 02.27 PM.PNG|thumbnail!  !Screen Shot 06-15-18 at 02.28 PM.PNG|thumbnail! ","18/Jun/18 4:42 PM;jjensen;[~jcox], [~tpatterson] & [~cleduc], this ticket has opened a door to several cans of worms, so I would like to document [a] what will be done with this ticket, and [b] what should be created as other tickets.

First, what will be done:
# The list pages for Mice, Litters, and Breedings will be changed, and none others.
# There are two categories of icons at the top of these lists: Actions and Item Actions.  The Actions are mostly the same and are drawn with the color $a0a0a0 (gray).  The Item Actions are colored white with a blue background.  Item Actions bear a relationship to the items selected in the list, whereas the Actions are independent of the list.  These two groups of icons will be moved into the pre-existing ActionBar div used previously only by the Cage Workbench.
# The gray ""x"" in the Actions icon list will be made white.
# Options available only under certain conditions in the Actions list will remain visible but disabled.
# The Actions icon list will shrink to a hamburger icon when the browser width shrinks to the bootstrap medium size or less.  Clicking on that icon will drop down a vertical list of the icons and their names as currently seen in the tooltips.  This menu will also be colored blue with white text/icons.

What should be done:
# A generic Epic Jira ticket needs to be created to hold all UI/UX tickets.
# A ticket should be generated (at least the shell of one) for these issues:
## Search design and functionality
## ""Add"" icons and their related pages (if needed) for each relevant list
## Make the icon changes for the rest of the lists as well
## List page template design (i.e. standardizing the look and feel)
## Card design
## Editable item design
## Overall visual standards and branding

I think you get the idea.  Ted mocked up something as well:
 !Selected_Items_Options.png|thumbnail! 
 !Ted_UI_Concepts_2018-06-18.jpg|thumbnail! ","19/Jun/18 8:04 AM;jjensen;[~tpatterson],[~cleduc], When Ted and I discussed the mockups, we thought the option on the far right was preferable to the others.  The plan for dropdowns is this:  Retain the colors (#1c75bc, which is a saturated steelblue in the case of selected items actions), provide a drop-down chevron icon to indicate the ability to show a menu, drop a vertical menu with the same coloring scheme, show only the available actions, replace the drop-down chevron with a drop-up chevron during menu display, and pull the menu back up on the chevron click.

@Carrie, there is a question on whether or not we should show all actions and have the unavailable ones disabled. However, that leads to a logical conclusion whereupon the menu should be available and shown when there are no items selected in the list as well, displaying all actions as disabled.  [~tpatterson] feels this is patently wrong and flies against the norms found elsewhere in web-based applications.  I agree with him, but we need your input on this as well.
","19/Jun/18 8:22 AM;cleduc;[~jjensen] [~tpatterson] What if, when nothing is selected do not show the menu related only to things selected. When one thing is selected I would like to see that menu, when more than one, I would like to see the same menu with the unavailable single options gray but still in the bar. Might help avoid the ""where'd it go, I could do this before, was I somewhere else, do I click somewhere else"" rabbit hole. Thoughts?","19/Jun/18 9:07 AM;tpatterson;I'm all for this approach [~cleduc]. While we don't have the real estate or need to show the selection actions at all times, showing disabled options will definitely help us curb confusion and push people to experiment.","29/Jun/18 10:28 AM;jcox;[~bwinter] [~jjensen], I added a note in the Description to instruct QA to ignore testing the view toggle button as part of this story's requirements.  ",09/Jul/18 2:59 PM;rwilliams;[~jjensen] Did this already go up to QA? I didn't see a pull request for it?,"09/Jul/18 4:45 PM;jjensen;So, I set you up as the Peer Reviewer, but I thought the pull request happened after the review was done.  FWIW, this particular ticket should probably not get a pull request yet as it is linked to the cage map ticket that I am working on currently.

Well, after I fixed the bug with the OffspringSettings not being created that I mentioned yesterday, these litters do not show up in cages. As far as I understand it, with the import, we are not creating litters unless they already have physical pups, and we are setting up the imported litter and pups as weaned, and therefore I would not expect to ever see an imported litter in a cage.","07/Jun/18 11:10 AM;jjensen;Dude, is there a pull request in the queue for this?

[~jcox], [~jmedlock] FYI about the card above.","25/May/18 4:26 PM;nnowak;Expected genotypes are correct.

We may want to consider female genotypes ""X/X"" for Y-Linked genes.

Let me know if  any of this is true, and I can update the ticket description.","07/Jun/18 11:12 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] There was one place you missed (gene card) that needed to be updated from Transgene Advanced to KIS. See this image:  !updated text on the gene card.png|thumbnail! 
Also, I posted pictures of the Transgene KIS and the Transgene KIS X sex linked and I had to change nothing to get them like they are. The is the item that I said I thought needed to be changed where the gene name and mut name should be reversed, but the more we talked through it and now looking at it closer, I think the current convention is the better way of doing it. This is just an FYI that I didn't change anything as far as the names of the GeneResults for KIS Transgenes. See:  !GeneResults for a Transgene Advanced.png|thumbnail!  !GeneResults for a Transgene Advanced X sex-linked.png|thumbnail! 
I am considering now the other change about moving the ""X/"" to the ""/X"". Let me know if you have any feedback. I think Nate favored the ""/X"" (always at the end).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","16/Aug/18 11:16 AM;cleduc;[~bwinter], [~apacio], [~jjensen] Thanks Bryan! Looks like we need to be sure that we say they should first filter by strain and then by genotype. They will expect to be filtered by both if they select under a strain and genotype but that's OK. This is a quick learn. 
There is utility for searching for a specific genotype and wanting to see all strains that contain it...so that's good in a way!
","16/Aug/18 11:52 AM;jjensen;[~bwinter], [~cleduc], this is all due to the fact that the filtering is done on text, not values.  There is no context on the filter in the Kendo grid.  Instead, it only asks if the text in the column contains the text selected from the list.  In pointing this out, you have revealed a feature that cannot be anticipated, but could be implemented within the C# code behind the update to this kind of page that will happen sometime in the future.  :)",17/Aug/18 11:04 AM;bwinter;Retested after silent QA push on 2018-08-17 @ 9:47 AM.

Production Issue - MouseList performing poorly and occasionally appears to be throwing sql timeout errors,COMA-2575,29219,,Bug,Production,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,Done,,rwilliams,rwilliams,15/May/18 2:25 PM,16/Jul/18 4:51 PM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,16/Jul/18 4:51 PM,,CM - Release 1.2,,,0,,,,,,,,"On my initial look into this issue, looking at dev tools, it appears that the mouselist page is duplicating the ajax call used to populate the list. For customers with 2500+ mice the sql view is taking from 5 seconds up to 9 seconds just to get the data from the database. As I was watching these two calls (which both return the same results and a pretty large set of data), I noticed that on occasion one of the calls would fail with a 500 and I believe that failure was a SQL timeout. As best as I know the page should not be making two calls.

Retire/Unretire Mouse functionality not working quite correctly,COMA-2560,29173,,Bug,Production,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,Done,,rwilliams,rwilliams,26/Apr/18 4:28 PM,16/Jul/18 4:47 PM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,16/Jul/18 4:47 PM,,CM - Release 1.2,,,0,,,,,,,,"h1. What happened:

# Go to Breedings
# Select Breeding where neither parent is retired
# Click Parents tab
# Click 3-dot menu for one of the parents
# Click Retire/Unretire
# Click save to retire parent
# Click 3-dot menu for same mouse
# There is no way to UNRETIRE mouse <- {color:#d04437}UNEXPECTED{color}
# User allowed to RETIRE breeding but other parent will be marked as UNRETIRED <- {color:#d04437}UNEXPECTED{color}

h1. What I expected to happen:

* I expected that clicking ""Retire/Unretire"" menu option from 3-dot menu would allow me to retire mouse and UNRETIRE mouse.
* I expected that retiring a breeding would automatically retire all breeders in breeding.


------------------------------------------


h2. Scenario:

# Go to breeding list and select a breeding so that you get the breeding card modal (for this scenario, there are 2 parent mice, neither are retired, and both of these parents are only parents on this one breeding)
# Click on the parents tab and then click the 3 dot menu for one of the parents and choose the ""Retire/Unretire"" option
# The dialog will give you the option to set the retire date for that mouse, but it won't let you retire the current breeding because there are currently two non-retired mice on the breeding. Set the retire date and then click save
# Next, for the same mouse as before, click the 3 dot menu and choose the ""Retire/Unretire"" option again
# Problem #1: The dialog looks very similar as before giving you a date to set the retire date on the breeding parent; there is now no way to unretire this mouse
# Problem #2: The dialog also now surmises that there is only 1 non-retired mouse on the breeding and therefore it gives you the option the go ahead and mark the breeding retired. The problem here is that the 1 non-retired mouse is the OTHER parent mouse on the breeding and not the mouse that you clicked on to retire. This would allow the breeding to get marked as retired, but leave the other parent as not retired.

h2. So, how should it work?

* For problem #1, if the selected mouse is already retired, the dialog should somehow allow the user to unretire the mouse.
* For problem #2, the count that the dialog is looking at to determine number of non-retired breeders on this breeding needs to exclude itself from the list of other breeders on this breeding and then the count of other non-retired breeders on this breeding it should check for is 0 before it lets the user check the box to retire the breeding.

h2. BA and DEV NOTE!! 

This retire dialog is the breeding/retiremouse dialog. There is an alternative ""Retire Mouse"" dialog at mouse/retiremouse. I think we need to consider modifying this dialog to look/work like the other one or modifying the other one to work in the context of the breeding. I think the other dialog is more clear about what is going on and I think it actually works correctly. The difference is that the mouse/retiremouse dialog runs for a mouse only doesn't consider the particular breeding that is popped up like the dialog at breeding/retiremouse. You can get to the mouse/retiremouse dialog by opening up a cagecard that has a breeding mouse in it, click on the 3 dot menu and you will find the retire/unretire option there.

 !breeding-retiremouse dialog.PNG|thumbnail!  !mouse-retiremouse dialog.PNG|thumbnail! 

h2. NOTE to SQA:

* I modified the mouse/retiremouse dialog so that if a breedingId was passed to it, it would show a green label that says  ""Selected Breeding"" after the breeding name in the retire mouse dialog. That way we get a reused and fully functioning retire/unretire mouse dialog but in the context of a particular breeding, that breeding is highlighted in the mouse's list of breedingparents/breedings.
* I moved some common business logic for breedings from views to the breeding business object - CanEditBreeding, CanDeleteBreeding, CanAddLitter, and a reason why those tasks may not be available. Updated some of the views to use some of these new properties to make them behave consistently. This allows us to reuse the logic across the entire application and stay consistent across the application",,,,;27/Apr/18 4:34 PM;rwilliams;28800,;05/May/18 12:44 PM;admin;600,;29/May/18 8:57 AM;bwinter;3600,;29/May/18 4:36 PM;bwinter;3600,;25/Jun/18 2:18 PM;bwinter;3600,,,,,0,40200,,,0,45900,,,,,,,,,,COMA-2624,COMA-2623,COMA-2622,,,,,27/Apr/18 3:37 PM;rwilliams;NEW breeding-retiremouse view.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/26818/NEW+breeding-retiremouse+view.png,29/May/18 4:35 PM;bwinter;PASSED - Checking retire breeding retires breedings and all breeders in a breeding - 2018-05-29 16_13_23-.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/26921/PASSED+-+Checking+retire+breeding+retires+breedings+and+all+breeders+in+a+breeding+-+2018-05-29+16_13_23-.png,26/Apr/18 4:29 PM;rwilliams;breeding-retiremouse dialog.PNG;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/26814/breeding-retiremouse+dialog.PNG,26/Apr/18 4:30 PM;rwilliams;mouse-retiremouse dialog.PNG;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/26816/mouse-retiremouse+dialog.PNG,27/Apr/18 2:43 PM;rwilliams;mouse-retiremouse for Mouse parent of 2 breedings.png;https://transnetyx.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/26817/mouse-retiremouse+for+Mouse+parent+of+2+breedings.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rwilliams,rwilliams,"{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2018-05-17T15:35:25.236-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""bitbucket"":{""count"":1,""name"":""Bitbucket Cloud""}}}}},""isStale"":false}}",,,COMA-2586,,,,,,,,,,,None,,,admin,,,Unassigned,,bwinter,0|i00xbj:,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,,2018-04-27 20:12:53.534,27/Apr/18 3:12 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams]  I think this looks great!

When filtering cages by ""Strain 3"", ""Cage ABC"" will NOT be returned in the results. After a litter is added to cage ABC, then the cage will be included in the filter results.

Note: I've attached some images from a production account (Levine, Michael at UCLA). They have several breedings with offspring strain of ""(Line 31000..."". 2 of these breedings do not have any litters yet and they are unable to find them when filtering cages. The iOS app had the same issue but has recently added that query when filtering cages by strain. See CMI-261.

*Logic from iOS (pseudo code because the actual code is harder to read because it is very specific to the data storage on iOS)*
When filtering cages by Strains (\[theStrainIds\])
* Include cages that have an associated litter with that strain (where any cage.litters.offspringstrainid IN \[theStrainIds\])
* Include cages that have an associated mouse with that strain (where any cage.mice.strainid IN \[theStrainIds\])
* Include cages that have an associated breeding with that strain (where any cage.mice.breedingParents.breeding.offspringstrainId IN \[theStrainIds\]).
** The iOS app does not currently exclude INACTIVE breedings because we couldn't figure out how to do it. However, it seems unlikely that a breeder would be in multiple breedings of different offspring strains AND it is not common to keep a breeder alive after they are retired. Generally they are euthanized after being retired. 

h2. *+Web Implementation Note:+*
Per instruction above the web DOES NOT exclude Inactive breedings either, *BUT* if needed or wanted, the web can only filter on Active breeding offspring strains.

h1. What I expected to happen

When submitting these results for {{<Y Probe>}}, {{<MUT probe>}}, and {{<WT probe>}}, I expected to see these {{<genotypes>}} for these mouse with this {{<sex>}}.

|| {{<sex>}} || {{<Y probe>}} || {{<MUT probe>}} || {{<WT probe>}} || {{<genotype>}} ||

| {{M}} | {{+}} | {{-}} | {{+}}  | {{X/Gene11<WT>}} |
| {{F}} | {{-}} | {{-}} | {{-}}  | {{X/X}} |

h1. Note to Testers
* The results engine does one main thing , the translation of probe results into generesults, however, it also provides an additional function. The additional function is the generation of the results matrix that is used on the Strain Linking Review page which shows all possible permutations for a given set of probesets (mutation/probe combinations). Obviously, the results matrix function uses the results translation function to get it results. All of that to say, what I found with this issue is that the results matrix function was using the results translation function slightly differently that Order Results page was using it and that is why the Strain Linking Review page looked fine for the scenario, but the Order Results page did not. All of this was just FYI.
* I also wanted to mention that while I was working on this ticket I noticed that the Genotypes were being displayed differently on the Order Results page than they were on the Strain Linking Review page. So, while I had this ticket open I also changed the display on the Strain Linking Review page to match the Order Results page. I mention this just so you will be aware in case anything strange comes up on the Strain Linking Review page. I don't anticipate anything, but I just wanted to let you know.
* IMPORTANT: I also added in some validation functionality for results, meaning that the string result must match one of it's predefined possible results. Then, for Sex-Linked mutations, I updated the check for a valid Y probe result to determine if the probe was run and if it had a valid result or not. If it wasn't run or if it was invalid, the results engine should now return ""Results returned with an undetermined code"" instead of using the sex of the sample that was being tested for the gender

","13/Apr/18 6:02 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], [~nnowak], [~qevans], The Gene Results Engine appears to be working really nicely!  In this screenshot below you can see that its order of operations is to use Y probe first in determining genotype before mouse sex (for sex-linked strains).  

In the screen shot below, for the male mice, a Y result of ""-"" treats mouse as if it were female to determine genotype.  For female mice, a Y result of ""+"" treats mouse as if it were male to determine genotype.  This might not be clear by how I labeled it, but if you look closely, you can see what I meant to say.  

Great job, [~rwilliams]!

This view uses the existing wellplate partialview that the wellplate edit page uses, with all data controls removed / disabled.

There is a parameter for the y probe and one for mosaic. So neither of those things will likely work right until they are wired up to the results engine. I’m actually working on some of that now because I am changing the source of the probe linking information from the StrainGeneAllele to the OrderStrainProbe, which is where we are taking a snap shot of the Strain linking info at the time the Order is created.

If a user selects mice to add to cull list from the test results view and hits the Assign Genotypes to Mice button, the add to cull list modal will appear correctly and the view refreshes, but genotypes will not be assigned to the samples (and view is not historical/read-only as would be expected).

This was tested and passed in COMA-2279, but has since regressed.
When hitting the Assign Genotypes to Mice button, genotypes should be assigned to mice once the add mice to cull list modal is saved. The results view should then be read-only.

Add Sync API method for fetching Groups and UserGroups,COMA-2506,29065,,Story,Production,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,Done,,tposchel,tposchel,05/Apr/18 11:35 AM,29/May/18 8:50 AM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,29/May/18 8:50 AM,,CM - Release 1.2,,,0,sync,,,,,,,"Related to COMA-2505 and in an effort to improve sync performance, the client application(s) need to be able to FIRST fetch a list of Groups and UserGroups for a given user so that individual ""sync per group"" can occur.

We _could_ just stick this method in /v1/sync or /v1/user controllers but we may want to start thinking ahead to what the API structure might look like if we had an 'online-only' version of the app vs the current 'offline' version. The online-only version of the API would need to have endpoints for all the different types of entities /groups, /mice, /labels, /cages, etc. This will take quite a bit more thought because we will likely have to include search query parameters to most of these endpoints, sort parameters, paging, etc.

The endpoints could go anywhere but my suggestion is this:

* (PRIMARY Importance) New API endpoint (GET /v1/groups)
** Returns an array of the same GroupDTO object we currently get as part of the /v1/sync/GetSyncPayload method call.
** This is ALL Groups the current user is a member of. No filtering whatsoever. Even include soft-deleted (dateDeleted != nil)
** Example response, shortened for brevity: 
{code:json}
{ ""groups"" : [ { ""groupId"" : ""FFF..."", ""name"" : ""Sandbox"", ""enrollmentKey"" : ""SANDBOX""}] }
{code}
* (SECONDARY Importance) New API endpoint (GET /v1/groups/userGroups or possibly /v1/userGroups or /v1/userGroups/associated)
** The rational for /v1/groups/userGroups is that it would imply ALL Groups and ALL those Groups' users (which is what we want).
** Returns an array of the same UserGroupDTO object we currently get as part of the /v1/sync/GetSyncPayload method call.
** This is ALL UserGroups ""associated"" with the user the logged in user, not just the ones where ""userId == currentUser.userId"". Even include soft-deleted (dateDeleted != nil)
*** This means that if the current user is part of 2 groups (A and B) and 'Group A' has 25 users and 'Group B' has 50 users, that the response to this API call will include 75 UserGroup records.
** Example response, shortened for brevity: 
{code:json}
{ ""userGroups"" : [ { ""userGroupId"" : ""FFF..."", ""groupId"" : ""FEF..."", ""userId"" : ""ABC...""}] }

This ticket may need more requirements and a decision on how exactly to handle mosaics.
Mosaic results were never part of initial results scope, but it came up today when I reported COMA-2501 to [~rwilliams], who probably needs to be in on this convo.
","04/Apr/18 2:26 PM;jcox;[~qevans] So if the mosaic option is selected, then when an impossible result is returned then we just display ""Mosaic"" - would we need any help-text for that like we already have for Inconclusive and Impossible?

CC [~jmedlock], [~bkoch], [~rwilliams]","04/Apr/18 3:30 PM;jmedlock;[~jcox][~rwilliams][~qevans] I remember we added that as a last minute item to accommodate for the FL/EX condition that technically would allow more than 2 mutations to be detected depending on where in the animal the sample was collected.

It may be easier to turn off mosaic options for now (hide the functionality) until we can get these requirements. I know Nate and Rich defined them but we need additional clarity. I think what Quincy has above is accurate. For a mosaic option. The Mosaic text would display instead of impossible but only if they have marked the mutation as mosaic.

Rich, if you can give us insight into time frame, we can decide if this is critical for 1.1.
[~cleduc]","05/Apr/18 10:01 AM;rwilliams;[~jcox] [~jmedlock] [~cleduc] [~qevans] [~bkoch] The Results Engine and the Strain Linking pages are already coded to handle the Mosaic scenarios, therefore the only changes that need to be made are to the Order Results page. Basically the a result can return as Mosaic, Impossible, Inconclusive or the actual selected genotype. All of those are already handled on the Order Results page with the exception of Mosaic. On top of that, I don't think that the UI will be behaving much differently than it currently does for Impossible. So, based on all of that, I think this would be a quick hit to modify the Order Results page to make it handle Mosiac. Brad, do you agree with my assessment?","05/Apr/18 10:47 AM;bkoch;[~rwilliams], if this is returning a genotype as mosaic, then would I have to modify the results page?  I would think I am just grabbing whatever genotype ID you are sending back, is this not the case?","05/Apr/18 11:03 AM;rwilliams;[~bkoch] You are correct that the Engine returns Mosaic as the result string, so nothing may need to be changed there, otherwise you just need to treat a ""IsMosaic"" result just like a ""IsImpossible"" result. There is also the question about help text and whether it should be different from what is displayed for Impossible (or whether any help text should show for Mosaic). [~qevans], can you help us out with the help text for Mosaic?","05/Apr/18 3:31 PM;qevans;[~rwilliams] [~bkoch] the only issue I'd bring up with treating this like impossible, is that while ""impossible"" is shown in the results view, it does not assign a genotype. To my understanding, if mosaic is the genotype, it should actually apply that to the mouse. There may be more work around that part of it.
Also, if a user has selected the mosaic option, they wouldn't need a help text if they get that result back; they'd be perfectly aware of what a mosaic genotype meant. So I don't think anything additional is needed there.
[~jmedlock] [~jcox]","05/Apr/18 4:27 PM;rwilliams;[~jcox] [~jmedlock] [~cleduc] [~qevans] [~bkoch] Someone will have to decide what needs to be done. There is no way for us to automatically suggest or assign a genotype because the results do not translate into one of our results. My thoughts are that this would work just like impossible, where the user is able to manually assign genotypes if they want to. I'm not sure that there is much else that we can do. ","05/Apr/18 5:02 PM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams][~qevans][~cleduc][~bkoch] Rich is correct the genotype structure does not allow for a string mosaic to be inserted. We would need to build a structure for mosaic now that we know it is a thing.

I see this as an advanced transgene option for mosaic genes. This would allow for different genotype possibilities for mosaic selected mutations.

Is that a big change? Sounds like it would be for this release.

I am going to get an answer from Nate regarding a solution for 1.1.

thanks,
","05/Apr/18 7:52 PM;cleduc;[~rwilliams] [~jmedlock] [~qevans] [~bkoch]  Unless there is something I don't know about the percentage of mosaics genotyped by transnetyx (maybe increased due to crispr?) my guess is this is too rare a need for 1.1. When we have a few more users we can get the requirements and put something specific in a later version.   
If based on ""mosaic"" gene type / expectation and ""impossible"" results we can warn or label the result easily great. If not, we rely on the user to interpret ""impossible"" as a likely mosaic in that set of genotyping and look into it.

1. Add a mouse to cart that does not have a linked strain.
2. Navigate to the shopping cart.
3. Biopsy mouse and click start new order.

h1. Testers Take Note!!
I wanted to let you know what all changed to make sure you tested all of the functionality:
* We are now taking (and keeping) a snap shot of the strain/probe linking information at the time the order is created based on the existing strain probe linking setup
* I removed the strain/probe linking locking functionality that we added a couple weeks back because with this new snap shot we should no longer need to lock it
* The linking info snap shot is created when an order is created, however you should also understand that whenever strain/probe linking information is updated, the snap shot information is deleted for all orders in Incomplete status and therefore the next time the user opens any of those orders or submits them, it will get a new updated copy of the snap shot.
* After an order is out of Incomplete status, the linking snap shot information should remain as is for the life of the order
* The results view has been updated to only use the linking snap shot instead of the live linking data
* The results view has been updated to handle the ""Y"" probe and the ""IsMosaic"" scenarios.
* The Probe/Results columns on the Order Results view have been reordered so that the Y probe always appears first in the list of columns if present and the rest of the probes are order by Gene Name, Allele Name and then Mut/WT. After that, any duplicate probes are removed (shared WildType Probes). It is *+{color:red}important {color}+*to understand that the Columns will no longer match those in the testing harness

h1. Dev Notes

* When creating an order, add enough data into required tables so that Colony can reconstruct the strain/probe linking information at the time the order was submitted. 
* Change the Results view to use the strain/probe linking information from the order instead of from the current Colony Strain.  
* See [~rwilliams] comments in COMA-2474.

After discussing with [~admin], if we do not nail this behavior correctly, it could cause serious bugs.

The main requirements are captured in the ""What I expected to happen"" section.  I have also re-worded as Given-When-Then below.  Please make sure these agree with the bullets in ""What I expected to happen"" section.

+Scenario+: _Biopsies only available to one order at a time_
*Given* a user is placing a genotype order 
*When* a mouse or pup's biopsy is placed on an order (regardless of order status)
*Then* that biopsy is no longer available for future orders

+Scenario+: _Biopsies only available to one order at a time_
*Given* a user is placing a genotype order on a mouse who has a biopsy in a previous order
*When* a mouse or pup is placed in the shopping cart without a new biopsy
*Then* throw the neeeds-biopsy icon in the required actions column of the shopping cart
*And* do not allow that mice to be check-able for an order until a new biopsy is created.

+Scenario+: _Deleting an order_
*Given* a user has an order started
*When* the user deletes that order
*Then* all the biopsies in that order becomes available for new orders.

At the moment, orders can ONLY be DELETED if the order status is INCOMPLETE.  {color:#d04437}If the above third scenario (_Deleting an order_) is accepted AND if we ever change what status allows an order to be ""deletable"", then we will need to carefully consider how to handle releasing biopsies.{color}","02/Apr/18 8:20 AM;cleduc;This seems correct. 
There is a scenario where they could take two biopsies at once - send one to Tyx and the other their own lab for other testing but  as this is rare I think it is OK if in that case they are prompted as in the second scenario and a new biopsy task is created. Keeps it simple.
Question: What happens if when deleting the order they would also like to delete the biopsies - determined they are not usable, or they lost the plate etc. 
","09/Apr/18 1:13 PM;admin;[~bwinter]

This was corrected by implementing an automatic biopsy for mice that have had their only existing biopsy sample assigned to a wellplate. This functionality will likely be enhanced in future iterations.

For the MVP, the testable scenario is:
1. Add a mouse that has not been biopsied to the cart.
2. Biopsy the mouse and add it to an order, but do not assign the available sample to a well.
3. Add the mouse to the cart again.
4. Add the mouse to an order and assign its sample to a well, save the wellplate.
5. Open the previous order and confirm that an auto-generated biopsy now exists (preventing an error).

For impossible genotypes, modify this text to reflect that no genotype is suggested by TYX because the probe result combination is impossible (rather than inconclusive).

Stephanie suggested that in the scenario where we have both inconclusive AND impossible, then we should just direct the user to contact customer service for more info rather than add even more text to the screen trying to explain that level of complication.  ""Please contact customer service for more information regarding this genetic possibility."" from the text listed above would work fine I think.

That is already in QA. There may be or may have been another ticket to deal with the actual code(s) (UD6, etc.), but I am not sure about that. What I remember hearing on the handling of the codes was simply to display in the UI the code and/or information specific to the code.

Also, as far as the display goes I don't know if it makes sense to actually allow for the assignment of genotypes on a deleted mouse therefore I would say that if this ticket is important enough that we lock that row so that genotypes can't be set and then put some indicator on the mouse showing that the mouse is dead. We do this current on the Mouse list by putting a black heart icon that has a white x on it beside the name of the mouse. Alternatively we could just show the dead mouse and allow the genotype to be applied. Might the customer want this for historic purposes? I am not sure what the implications might be for the second scenario because pretty much everything that we do on the server side automatically excludes deleted (and dead and transferred) mice. In fact, you may want to go ahead and account for those scenarios as well.
And, yes, I would assign this to Brad (unless he has a lot of heartburn about it ;)).","02/Apr/18 4:14 PM;cleduc;[~rwilliams], [~bkoch], [~bwinter], [~jmedlock] 
This may be a done deal but my two cents: I would warn the user if they are trying to DELETE a mouse with samples taken or offspring. If they want to continue with the delete then we need to know what to do regarding that associated data ""delete associated litters and genotypes?"" - and/or could display that data with a mouse deleted indicator as said above.  Delete indicates an error was made in either creating the mouse or naming it or an error is being made now in selecting it for delete (I've done the latter). 
For a mouse now Dead or Transferred, I would not do anything to up or downstream data and would not send an error. The data is still relevant, but if users have asked, I would indicate it's dead with an icon or popup maybe.
(I know I'm not on the ticket but I'm looking at every single one for release notes so ...  happy to talk about this with Brad or whoever doesn't have heartburn :P). ","06/Apr/18 5:22 AM;bkoch;[~rwilliams] [~cleduc], I think I'll take your advice and not assign downstream data to dead or transferred mice, so I'll just exclude them from the results screen.  Thanks!","06/Apr/18 8:19 AM;cleduc;[~bkoch] [~rwilliams] Sorry - making sure of which way the stream is running...Dead or transferred mice do still need the genotype assigned. 

","06/Apr/18 8:28 AM;bkoch;[~cleduc], oh, ok, I'll keep them on the results screen then.","06/Apr/18 8:40 AM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] [~bkoch] We need to get some clear direction for this ticket. There is some confusion with it currently. First off, the ticket really is not about deleting mice and what to do in that scenario. If we need to change that then we need another ticket. I think we got off the rails with earlier comments and questions. So to get back to the reason this ticket was created in the first place, the issue is that when the user gets to the OrderResult page, if a mouse that the user sent a sample in to be tested was deleted (and probably same for transferred or marked dead as well) before the OrderResults came back, then the page throws an error. I am 99.999% sure that the reason for that is because on the server side, when we look up the mouse in the database to match to the sample in the order, we are not getting the mouse back because we are automatically filtering out mice with those statuses. So, I think the immediate fix for this ticket is to change the query for mice for the OrderResults page so that it doesn't exclude those mice in the query. I think you can allow for the assignment of the genotyoes as well without any issues, however, going forward, it may be difficult or impossible for the user to see that mouse or its applied genotypes because we so often filter out mice that are in these statuses. If we want/need to do more than this then I think we need additional tickets that specify those additional requirements.","06/Apr/18 9:47 AM;cleduc;[~rwilliams] [~bkoch] Thanks for bringing me back on the rails. I like your solution of removing the filter. Is more needed from me?

It is fine that the user needs to work a little harder to see genotypes of dead/transferred mice and certainly fine for deleted.

As discussed Friday, this ticket exposes a difference in the way that Colony and QO are evaluating the number of used control samples for a strain. QO still performs this calculation per strain per order, Colony implements (the intended future behavior of QO) by calculating free samples across all orders of this strain.

Thus, a displayed pricing mismatch between the two systems will exist until QO is updated (Colony, in some cases, will appear to be more expensive when compared side by side since it's not granting free controls so liberally).

This will be classified as a known issue and ""functions as expected"".

Jwala has a good approach planned to solve this issue permanently, by converting the free control sample FR17 code to a standard user discount which acts exactly like all other discounts. 

In my estimation, this is a low risk issue (Custom Service manual intervention mitigates, when necessary). ","09/Apr/18 8:32 AM;bwinter;[~admin], Thank you for the update!

_I am adding bold emphasis below to make it easier to scan the highlights._

The Parent ticket - COMA-2323 -  for this rework states that *strains linking should NOT be editable* when an order is in one of these statuses:

* *NotReceived*
* *Received*
* *InProgress*
* _*ProbeArrived*_ \*
* *PartiallyCompleted*

*I accidentally added these 2 order status* to the description in this rework:

* Completed
* GenotypeAssigned

[~admin], [~jmedlock] Should we allow strains to be editable when an order status is in *Completed* status or *GenotypeAssigned* status?
_____________________________________________________________________

\* _*ProbeArrived*_ is not a status that an available status to send from the testing harness.  We will need to discuss with [~rjonakin] if that is something that needs to be tested.","29/Mar/18 11:03 AM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], [~admin], as you guys are working on getting feedback for this ticket, I wanted to mention that [~qevans] coincidentally messaged me today that editing strain linking, _while_ an order status is complete _but before_ genotypes are assigned, changes the results view on the gene results page.

Here is the trade-off as I understand it:

* If we *add completed* status to the list of order statuses that lock strain linking wizard, then linked strains with orders left in completed status will not be editable via strain linking wizard
* If we *do not add completed* status to the list of order statuses that the lock strain linking wizard, then a user could inadvertently change the results view for all orders of that strain with a completed order status.

CC: [~rwilliams], [~jcox]","29/Mar/18 11:23 AM;jmedlock;[~bwinter][~admin][~rwilliams] We should lock Strain linking in any order status except Applied Genotypes. At that status the order should be considered complete except retests.

This structure could cause issue later. We will need to discuss. The order state needs to NOT be affected by strain changes but i know that creates a bunch of other issues to consider.","29/Mar/18 11:47 AM;admin;[~rwilliams]
It feels like we are starting to paint ourselves into a corner with this locking paradigm.
What say we re-imagine the safety mechanism entirely and talk about how we can instance strain->probe setup to an order, maybe? Think about what that structure might look like and lets spitball some ideas.
","29/Mar/18 12:50 PM;rwilliams;[~admin] I doubt anything will happen before Tuesday. I have the planned code changes for this ticket ready to go to develop, but I am not sure what if anything I should do now. Should I go ahead and commit what I have? I have not changed any of the included statuses, but I can include completed if you think that is the right thing to do for now. I kind of feel that I ought to get something in now, because the locking is not working at all right this minute. And by not working I mean that it always reports back that it doesn't need to be locked.","29/Mar/18 2:42 PM;rwilliams;[~admin] [~jmedlock] I was just talking to Jim about this issue and I think he helped me to understand what you were saying in your previous comment. Tell me if this sounds right. Chris, just as you are now saving the OrderStrain and the OrderStrainProbe information for orders, I think we need to add enough data into these tables so that we can reconstruct the strain/probe linking information at the time the order was submitted. And then, we need to change the Results view to use the strain/probe linking information from the order instead of from the current Colony Strain.","29/Mar/18 4:09 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] I added the Completed status to the original list of statuses, but we need to redo the order/strain/probe linking stuff so that we preserve a snapshot of that information at the time the order is submitted. That way we can unlock strain linking most, if not all, of the time because the order will carry the information it needs for translating results, etc.","29/Mar/18 5:28 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams] I created COMA-2490 and COMA-2489 in response to your comments.  

* COMA-2490 - _Store enough data to reconstruct strain and probe linking information at the time of order creation_ - is a place holder for your original comments.  
* COMA-2489 - _Prompt user to apply strain linking changes to all orders in INCOMPLETE status_ - is a potentially nice-to-have based on your comments, which may help reduce customer effort.

This ticket originated from some unexpected behavior occurring when placing orders in Colony.  After speaking with [~rjonakin], the observed behavior may be do to well plate ID.  Below are some additional tests to verify behavior.  If the tests below fail, contact [~bwinter] for further investigation.

+New Well Plate ID Requirements:+

* Must be 25 characters or less\* 
* Must start with B, E, T (case-sensitive)
* Remaining characters must be integer
* Must be assigned to group owner's QO account \*\*

\* To create well plate IDs longer than 15 characters, follow these instructions\*\*\*:

# Log into ORMA
# Click Shipping Tab
# Click Supply Requests from fly-out menu
# Make sure you are on the Supply Requests tab
# Enter your email into Start New Supply Request field just below the Supply Requests tab
# Enter FedEX Tracking #
# Select FedEx Packaging
# Select Well Plates from Supply drop-down
# Select number to send from # To Send drop-down
# Click Add to Shipment button
# Enter a bunch of well plate barcode numbers
# Click Fulfill Request

\*\* When the group owner is a member of an organization with a TAGCenter, the well plate ID could also be assigned to any user who is NOT the group owner but who has the role of Central Shipper for that organization.

However, it may not be likely that someone starts a order in Colony but completes it in QO.  So please feel free to move this bug ticket to another release.

The main risk at the moment, is if this ticket is not resolved, a user, who does start an order and Colony but completes in QO, will be allowed to place the same order again even though the order is already marked in QO.  This throws a hard YSOD error.  Confer with [~admin] if this will cause any other downstream effects.

Good catch on this error. I didn't think of this problem before, but reading this ticket I know exactly why this is not working.

The gist of it is QO and OM do not update the order status of ""Not Received"" thet same way it handles the updating of all other order statuses. Both apps just set the order to ""Not Received"" in the code that is tied to the Finalize button click event in both applications, instead of using the LabSupport method of updating like every other order status....

It will take me about a day (maybe a little less but more than half a day) to fix this in QO and OM.

I just ran across this ticket and was not aware of it's existence. I spoke with Chris and did some work a few weeks back that did some order processing for Colony orders submitted to Quick Order. In short, this work will send the Quick Order confirmation of an order email to any user that submits an order via Colony. So maybe this can be held off and not a 1.1 ticket.

this work is attached to ORMA‌-536

I don't know if there were reasons to not create those gene results or not, so I defer to [~jmedlock] on that. I hate to mention this, but if you edit a TG Adv Gene (gene card), the ""Advanced"" option doesn't seem to show that it is on - AND if you turn it on and save, it appears to duplicate some of the gene results. That may explain how to create the duplicates you see in your screen shot. Also, there was a conscious decision to not allow for Transgene Advanced Sex-Linked Y back then. I think Nate said it was extremely rare or that it didn't make much sense, I can't remember, but that was done on purpose at the time. I added a couple screen shots to show what GeneResults the application currently generates for Transgenes Advanced (not sex-linked) and for Transgene Advanced Sex-linked X just so it was clear on what is currently being generated versus what is expected.","21/Mar/18 4:00 PM;bwinter;Great points, [~rwilliams]!

If I understand the problem correctly, only the unique translations show up in the gene card.  However, the tables I added to the ticket description have probe results in them.  By my comment:

bq. ""The translations on the gene card should NOT include the probe presence \(+\) or absence \(\-\).""

I am trying to say that adding +'s and -'s to the gene card is NOT part of the ticket.

I may need [~jcox] to work his magic on this card to clear up what I have muddied.","23/Mar/18 8:50 AM;jcox;I confirmed with [~rwilliams] that their is an issue with the results display in QA right now that was introduced since the last Staging/Prod deployment.  His screenshots with the red highlighting point out that issue.

I've created COMA-2471 to reflect the additional bug that Rich pointed out in a previous comment, where the Advanced option toggle can lead to duplicated results listing.","03/Apr/18 2:41 PM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], [~jcox], the testing passed for creating advanced transgenes.  Thanks, [~rwilliams].  I just wanted to mention, that creating sex-linked-Y advanced transgenes still has that feature where selecting the Y checkbox switches OFF the ""Show Advanced Options"" switch and changes sex-linked advanced transgene to sex-linked (simple) transgene.

 !CONCERNED - Colony will not let user create Advanced Transgenes sex-linked to Y chromosome - 2018-04-03 11_12_38-.png|thumbnail! 

One consequence of this is that we cannot technically test the Gene Results Engine for sex-linked-Y advanced transgene, which is a scenario in Rich and Nate's Possible Gene Results spreadsheet.

After discussing the background with Rich, it sounds like sex-linked-Y advanced transgenes is rare anyway, but I wanted to bring this up in case we wanted to create a future story about changing this in Colony.  If we do create a new story, let's add a note to SQA to test Gene Results Engine and possible reference this comment in this ticket.

","03/Apr/18 2:47 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] [~jmedlock] [~jcox] Just to add... The original specification for Colony did not call for implementing the Transgene Advanced Y Sex-linked scenario.

The requirements were there for MVP. Somehow we tested and passed the adv. Transgene y sex linked option without it being functional. It actually may have been an option at 1 point though and was removed in a bug.,"03/Apr/18 2:54 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] I remember looking at the original spec and it was confusing at best. It was like the scenario was listed, but then when you went to look for the details there were none in the spec. Also, with the way that the UI works, it appears that it was designed to work that way. In other words, it doesn't look like it was an accident or a bug that caused it to work the way that it does.
The original spec is attached here:  [^Transgene Compilation.pdf]

All of the needed parts are already in place. The UI would have to modified to allow for it to be selected and then the backend would need to be checked to make sure that it would handle the creation of GeneResults appropriately and the edit screen for the Gene Card would need to checked to make sure that it would work as expected for this scenario as well. The Results Engine should already account for the scenario.","03/Apr/18 3:36 PM;cleduc;[~jmedlock][~rwilliams][~bwinter] 
I'm afraid this isn't helpful but I'm trying to catch up on this one. Straighten out my thinking...I'm guessing advanced isn't an option as actual Y linked will not be homozygous, unless an animal has two Y chromosomes.  We can have that Y linked gene inserted (transgene) on a different chromosome and therefore have a homozygous result but then it isn't actually Y chromosome linked anymore. If we insert it multiple times on the Y we wouldn't be looking at zygosity but at copy number... 
All that said, it is OK to give all functionality and let the user figure out what they want to call things. ","03/Apr/18 3:53 PM;jmedlock;[~cleduc] [~rwilliams][~bwinter] Carrie i think it is very helpful, it puts the priority of fixing the y linked adv option into perspective. It literally is a very risk low case. Not something we will likely be asked to do very soon.

The bug currently exists and so we need another ticket to fix that bug down the road just so we cover all options.

Here is the original code for the mouse name (title: Mouse Id) column:

{code:java}
                  columns.Bound(m => m.MouseName)
                      .ClientTemplate(""#=MouseName# #if (IsDead == true) {# <span class='mouse-dead' data-placement='right' data-toggle='tooltip' title='This mouse is dead'></span>#} else if (MarkedForCull == true) {# <i class='zmdi zmdi-block' data-placement='right' data-toggle='tooltip' title='This mouse is on your cull list'></i>#}#"")
                      .ClientGroupFooterTemplate(""Count: #=count#"")
                      .HtmlAttributes(new { ugmid = ""#=MouseId#"" })
                      .Title(""Mouse ID"");
{code}

If I change the bound field to say:

{code:java}
    columns.Bound(m => m.MouseSortName)
{code}

Then nothing is shown in the grid at all!!.  However, if I comment out:

{code:java}
    //.ClientGroupFooterTemplate(""Count: #=count#"")
{code}

The data shows up, but the grouping counts disappear.  I will continue to hack away, but this is frustrating.
","22/May/18 4:22 PM;jjensen;[~rwilliams], nvm.  I done figured it out an' stuff.  Had to change the Aggregates section...d'oh!","23/May/18 8:07 AM;jjensen;On development, in Dev Group, after sorting with the new algorithm, the following can be observed:
 !Screen Shot 05-23-18 at 07.54 AM.PNG|thumbnail! 
This is the mice in ""a whole new strain"" strain, ordered by the Mouse Id column.  Note how ""2sdf"" is followed by ""153"".  This is due to the way the Mouse.Name values are split into numeric and string segments and then ordered.  Numerically, 153 follows 2, because the numeric values in front are ordered in a numeric fashion.  Likewise, 12343234234 follows 9961-2xxxxx, because 12343234234 is numerically greater than 9961, which is the first numerical segment of 9961-2xxxxx.

Please also note as shown in Ethan's New Strain, the way the ordering works with mouse names that begin with non-digits and then are followed by digits:

Here, ""p512"" follows ""p54"", as requested.
","23/May/18 8:50 AM;jjensen;Only one spot found that seems odd, but explained by looking closely at the names:
 !Screen Shot 05-23-18 at 08.44 AM.PNG|thumbnail! 
This is from strain ""JawalaTestStrain1"".  The name ""Jwala's Room Rack 1 Cage2 Mouse 4"" comes before ""Jwala's Room Rack1 Cage1 Mouse 2"", when it _looks_ like it should be listed after.  But, it is the presence of the space character in ""Jwala's Room Rack 1 Cage2 Mouse 4"" after the word ""Rack"" which makes it sort earlier.

-So, the question is: should spaces be ignored?-

Edit:  Spaces should not be ignored.  The algorithm is correct.","29/May/18 8:26 AM;bwinter;[~cleduc], [~jcox], judging by the attached screen shots from [~jjensen], it looks like he NAILED this ticket!  Go Jim!  I plan to test when the Mice List gets fixed In QA.

In the mean time, I just wanted to give you a heads up that the requirements of this card state that user wants to be able to sort by mouse ID which implies the Mouse List.   After users see the Mouse List is sortable by Mouse ID, I imagine they will expect Mouse IDs to be sorted accordingly elsewhere in Colony.  However, everywhere else Mouse cards or List rows are sorted alphabetically ""string-wise"" instead of alphanumerically.

So I created COMA-2598 to list all the places in Colony where we could apply [~jjensen]'s alphanumeric sort method.  I placed it in *Unplanned*, but you may want to consider placing it in* Colony 1.2*.

There was some discussion around moving the sorting farther down the call chain, ideally at the SQL Server level.  Having the special character-numeric ordering done in SQL Server, however, is impossible without creating a special routine via C# code which can be called by the SQL Server engine (normally called a ""CLR Assembly"").

The bottom line is that an analysis must be done to determine the best location for code which can be shared, and I think no one currently has any idea of what the real impact would look like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That way the user can decide if they want the Y probe to run just like any of the other probes on the strain.
Also, this should probably only be for sex-linked genes that have a Y probe in the linked QO strain. We wouldn't want to automatically add a Y probe when it wasn't on the QO strain to start with. I don't know how often that would even happen even, but could be an edge case.

","20/Mar/18 3:32 PM;bwinter;[~qevans] I created a change request, COMA-2457, for adding Y probe to bulk edit probe list, so that user can toggle Y probe ON/OFF.  

I spoke with Nate yesterday (Mar 19), and he said strains with sex-linked genes may not necessarily need Y probe.  However, sex is necessary to determine a genotype for a sex linked gene.  Furthermore, strains may have Y probe added for situations where the mice's sex cannot be phenotypically identified, e.g., embryos.

In summary, it appears that if the QO strain includes the Y probe (whether or not the underlying gene is sex-linked), then the Y probe should be available for toggling ON/OFF.

I am still new to all this, does this make sense?  Let's discuss more if I have misunderstood your comment above or if I am misunderstanding the use of Y probe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remove Parent Mice from Breeding when the Breeding is Deleted,COMA-2433,28964,,Bug,Staging,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,,,jcox,jcox,14/Mar/18 9:54 AM,18/May/18 2:41 PM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,,,CM - Release 1.1,,,0,,,,,,,,"Current on the web interface when a Breeding is deleted, if any mice were associated with that breeding they are not also being disassociated (Soft Deleted) from the Breeding.  This is affecting the iOS app as it is now able to handle that process correctly but the app is syncing down data that was handled incorrectly by the web interface.

How it should work:
+Scenario+:
*Given* I am deleting a breeding that has parents but no litters
*When* The breeding record is removed / marked-as removed
*Then* The association between the parent mice and the breeding should also be removed
*And* The Offspring Settings for the breeding should be removed
*And* If the parent mice are not a member of any other breedings, then their Use should be set to Available

We will also need a SQL script written+executed to fix the Mice records in the DB that are set to an incorrect Use value due to this bug.  Per [~jmedlock] the logic should be:

IF Mouse Use = Breeding 
    AND all Breedings for that mouse have been soft deleted
    OR mouse is dead
    OR mouse is transferred
THEN set Use = Available

* When breeding is deleted, mice not in another breeding has use = Available.
* When breeding is deleted, mice in another breeding has use = Breeding.

These two acceptance criteria appear to me to be untestable from the UI:

* *Then* The association between the parent mice and the breeding should also be removed
* *And* The Offspring Settings for the breeding should be removed

We still have 2 potential problems with counts of active/alive mice/litters. We almost have this!!!

Staging environment/Bush group

In the web, 326 mice are reported alive on dashboard and list. The counts on the strain cards state 327. iOS states 327. The total mouse count for bush group in staging is 906 (matches iOS list). The database says 906 total. The mouse list in web states with 0 filters, 900 mice.

Staging environment/Sandbox group

The iOS shows Litter 20 has 18 pups, 7 dead, 11 missing. 2 male, 2 female. The male and female mice are marked dead or missing but the iOS counts this litter as active. The web does not. The number of mice dead or missing = the total born, this litter should not be active.

Do you see this as fixed in staging? 

Here is their recent statement and then the steps. Confirmed this is still an issue. Using the exact same steps I looked at the data for the Wilkerson group and it doesn't match up either. The dashboard is showing 7 cages with 6+ mice, while I could only find 1 on the cage map. My guess would be that cages containing pups over a certain age (21 or 28 days) are throwing the data off from the dashboard. Criteria for what constitutes an adult mouse should be the same on the dashboard and cage map. 

Steps:
from Dashboard, within ""cages"" red box...hold mouse over one of the bars in the ""mice in cage"" graph...I see ""6+ mice (9)""...which I understand to mean I have 9 cages containing 6+ mice. I want to see information about these cages, so I click on the cage tab at the top. Firstly I can only see my cages one rack at a time. So I filter the first rack to see cages containing 6+ mice, and I see one cage come up. i select a second rack...I have to reset the filter for 6+ mice, 0 cages come up. I select my third rack, reset the filter for 6+ mice, and 3 cages come up. Total of cages with 6+ mice=4. Where is the 9 coming from from the dashboard??","25/Jun/18 10:51 AM;bwinter;[~cleduc], Okay.  I see same problems in *Staging > Wilkerson Lab*.  I am not quite sure what is going on.  It looks like possibly several separate issues.  Below is a table of differences and the cages that are being counted differently.  What else would like me to investigate?

For some reason, this information is needed to generate a LIMS Order ID.  

Until I manually added a default address in QO on QA2, none of my orders submitted via Colony had a LIMS Order ID.  An order not having a LIMS Order ID is somehow related to throwing YSOD whenever one clicks the view order button from ORMA.  New orders placed in Colony since selecting default billing and shipping addresses are now showing order details (instead of YSOD) when clicking the blue view order button.  However, orders placed before selected default billing and shipping addresses are still showing YSOD when clicking the blue view order order, presumably because the LIMS Order ID was never created for these past orders.

I see your account has an order in ORMA QA2 for well plate C2005000, which is also throwing YSOD when clicking the blue view order button.  I imagine future orders will be fixed after selecting default billing and shipping addresses in QO QA2.

You are correct. This is a side effect of NOT having a LimsOrderId. Status updates are done through Labsupport and that works off the LimsOrderId for finding orders, and that value is null for colony orders currently. So there is not a correct order status update happening in the background.

I think in our initial conversation that we concluded that while litters and mice are in the cart, we don't want to see (include) deleted or dead or transferred mice. For example, if a user adds a litter of 2 to the cart and then weans one mouse and marks the other one dead, when you then look at the cart the cart only shows one weaned alive mouse - correct? However, once the user adds the litter/mouse to an order, if that mouse gets marked as dead or transferred we still want to show it in the mouse/sample counts and as part of the order and even the sample on the well plate - Correct? Lastly, what happens to mice that are deleted after they are added the order? Does it disappear from the order and the well plate? Or do we leave it on there? Last we talked I think we were saying that if a mouse was deleted we would want it to go away, however, I think that makes things messy on the order as things will automagically disappear, even from the well plate. So, after thinking through this and talking to [~mbender] about it, I think we need to just leave the order/samples alone (meaning that we do not filter out mice that were added to an order but have since been marked as dead, deleted, or transferred). If the user deletes, marks dead, or transfers a mouse after it is in an order then they will have to manually not exclude that mouse sample from the well plate if they don't want to pay for it. Thanks for listening to me think this through. Let me know your thoughts.","07/Mar/18 4:02 PM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams] I did not read all of that. 

The short response is that users may want to genotype animals that got marked dead, transferred, or went missing after they were clipped.

We need to handle mice and samples differently, if mice went missing/died before clipping, we cant genotype them, we need to handle that also from the litter standpoint.

[~cleduc] I may be unfairly bring Carrie into this conversation but who said software development was fair. Carrie anything to add here.","07/Mar/18 4:10 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] [~bwinter] It makes sense that we should handle samples and mice separately, The issue though is that the user is adding mice to the cart, not samples. I already worked on another ticket last week that then led to this ticket this week because as it turns out, when you add an unweaned litter to the cart and then wean the litter and mark some of those mice as dead, the dead mice do not get IDs and because of that, the litter gets stuck with the required action of ""needing to be IDed"". To fix that, last week I just excluded all deleted, dead and transferred mice from the cart.",07/Mar/18 6:15 PM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams] sounds like u got it under control,"09/Mar/18 9:43 AM;cleduc;I missed the party on this one but it seems all worked out. My two cents: if the sample is in the plate/order and then the mouse is marked dead, we leave it on the order. This is because the info on the genotype of the mouse may still be relevant to the user - most especially if the animals are sampled at 2 weeks but don't make it to wean and it is a certain genotype not making it. They can make the determination to omit it if they want. For new plates/orders I think it is good to have the dead mice not show. There are use cases where we genotype tissue saved from a dead mouse. We do need to create a sample from a dead mouse but that process is not the norm. ",09/Mar/18 10:30 AM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] Thanks for your input.

Tyler: Florin investigated further for me and I have confirmed. As a user who is part of the SANDBOX group, when performing a sync, 6 MouseGeneResult entries are returned whose corresponding GeneResultId == ‘976C1BC9-0F73-414C-9E94-1A900A3817E8’. However, the sync payload does NOT include an actual GeneResult object whose GeneResultId matches. I confirmed that in the QA database there is in fact a GeneResult that matches and is part of the same group and is not deleted so I do not see any reason why it would be excluded from the payload but somehow it is being excluded.
The sync is not sending ALL the GeneResults for that Group and I don’t know why. I’m fairly confident it doesn’t have anything to do with the actual strain.

*Acceptance Criteria*:
* The dashboard biopsy/ID count should not eliminate litters that were weaned and not biopsied
* If all the pups are dead or missing in a litter that needed biopsy, this litter should not be included in the count or show on the filtered list.

NOTES:
The iOS does this already so we need to match what is happening there for ""counts"" consistency.
The user needs to know which actions were performed on a litter at a glance. Currently the web removes litters that were weaned from the active count and so allows users to ""skip"" the biopsy step.
Users should be able to wean and biopsy a litter at any time.

*Dev Notes:*
* Existing logic for biopsy count: Count of litters where (litterIsActive & NotBiopsied & BiopsyNeeded)

A user deletes a litter or mouse from Colony, even when that mouse/litter is in the shopping cart/orders lists. 
Which then throws a hard error if you try to validate that mouse/litter.

The Change:

When a user tries to delete a mouse/litter from Colony, warn the user that this mouse/litter is in the cart and will removed there as well if deleted.

*Steps To Recreate*:
1. Add a litter or mouse to cart that has not been ID/Biopsied.
2. Delete the litter/mouse from Colony.
3. Back to shopping cart and click the biopsy icon next to sample.
4. You will receive a hard error. See track trace below.

*DEV Notes:*
* As opposed to warning the user that a mouse or litter is in the cart when they delete it, I spoke to Bryan and we agreed that I would modify the cart count badge and the cart page itself to exclude deleted/dead/transferred litters and carts. Therefore, if you delete a mouse or litter, when you go to look at the cart, the item will no longer show up.

*May need to re-label two tabs*

Now that Colony allows the user to link strains in QuickOrder to strains in Colony, there is a modal accessible from the Gene Mutations list that has two tabs whose labels may need to be changed so not to cause confusion with this new idea of ""linking"" strains between Colony and QuickOrder.

*Screenshot*

!change name of linked strains tab in Edit Gene Mutations Modal - 2018-02-23 09_09_42-Allele List.png|thumbnail! 

*Labels that may need re-labeling*

The two labels in question are

* *Linked Gene(s)* tab - _lists details about the gene(s) in Colony that contain the mutation_
* *Linked Strain(s)* tab - _lists the strains in Colony that contain this mutation_

*Example of possible confusion*

One example that comes to mind is the user somehow thinking this modal as confirmation that strains have been linked.

Can you provide some suggestions for new labels for these two tabs?","23/Feb/18 3:34 PM;nnowak;[~bwinter]

# ID and biopsy pups -> *missing* and *dead* pups will not be ID'd, which works as expected
# Click Save
# Go back to shopping cart
# Litter still has ID icon listed as a required action for the litter

3. Select a cage that does not have a mouse with the selected strain.
4. Add a mouse to that cage with the selected strain.
5. Navigate to the mice list and click edit on the mouse you added.

There are known scenarios where IIS will predictively cache layout elements unless manually prevented in its configuration.

Instead of trying to investigate and prevent that behavior, we will instead remove the Razor templating around the display name in the header partial and re-implement that functionality into a Document.Ready Ajax call in the layout template proper.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Remove the server side Razor template for current user display name
* Create a discrete Controller action and Ajax call to provide the user name data post render and apply it to the appropriate element values late. This should side step any server caching issue.

I have a conjecture about what might be causing it. Thinking about how it could happen, I'd expect a static method in the call stack accessing user principal data in a concurrency-race type situation (UserA accessed the method just as UserB's context came into scope on the server).

It would be super tricky to catch in the act but any of the devs should be able to put on their Sherlock Holmes hat and track down whats going wrong.

We thought this bug was fixed at one time, but it is still lurking out there and appears to crop up whenever users are logging in at times near each other.  Or at least this is my observation.  [~admin] can explain more.

Nonetheless, we may want to *prepare a response* before hand on why users are seeing other user names in the Account Profile instead of their own.  We may also want to better *understand any associated security risks*.

If there is at least 1 item in the cart then the item count updates in real time. This does not occur when the first item is added to an empty cart.

Steps to recreate:
1. Clear cart of all items.

3. Add a sample to the cart.
4. User will not see the cart icon change, no numbers present.
5. Hard refresh the page and the icon has changed with the respective number of samples added.
6. If user adds another sample the icon will begin to update in real time.

*Dev Notes:*
* Added some jquery code to the layout and header to act on all ajax calls and automatically update the cart count; fixed the cart page  in cart total so that it updated as you removed items from the cart;
* Reworked the get cart items to reduce some of the database calls and to reuse calls that where previously modified to remove dead/deleted/transferred mice and litters from the shopping cart

Thanks!,"12/Mar/18 5:04 PM;bkoch;[~rwilliams] [~mbender], this appears to be an issue because in the qa automation group, the QA Gene has 120 different mutations assigned to it, and every time that a new one is added, it is creating permutations of every one of the existing mutations with the new mutation.  I'm not sure if this is ever going to be apparent in the Production enviroment (are there ever more than a couple mutations on one gene), but it's appearing as though for every permutation, it takes about 1/3 to 1/2 of a second to generate (in my local environment), which would make sense that 120 permutations would take 40 to 60 seconds.  If this is an issue to be followed up on, we need to fundamentally change how we are generating the generesult permutations.","13/Mar/18 8:04 AM;rwilliams;[~bkoch] Good catch!. Because almost all of the mutations that are part of this group all belong to the same Gene, any time that you add a new mutation to that same gene it has to create that many more gene result combinations. 
[~mbender] I would suggest going forward that you try and keep the mutation to gene ratio down to a few mutations per gene to avoid this. If you want I can look at cleaning up some of these mutations in QA to try and get it back to performing better. Let me know what you want me to do on that. Otherwise, I would suggest to [~bkoch] that we close this ticket for now.","19/Mar/18 10:44 AM;bwinter;[~jcox] [~jmedlock]  Can you read the description and comments for this ticket and provide guidance to [~rwilliams], [~bkoch], and [~mbender], and me about whether to cancel this ticket or take further steps listed in [~rwilliams]'s last comment?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the meantime, I also put in a fix on something i had not seen with COMA-2647: adding certain text in the search field(and searching on that) results in an IIS error which states in part that 
{code:java}

The angle bracket pairs (""<"", "">"") cause this.","10/Aug/18 2:42 PM;jjensen;[~cleduc], [~jcox], [~tpatterson], we need to have a conversation on some further refinements to this ticket.  At this moment, the one thing that comes to mind is the need for some kind of indicator on the CGV that tells the user what they're really looking at.  I mean, if a user clicks on any of the dozens of hotspots on the dashboard, walks away to get coffee, then comes back, they need some indicator on the page which tells them how the cages were selected.

Secondly, we need to say something about what actions can be taken on the data.  There are eyeball icons and checkboxes in the mockups.  Generally, I understand these to be drill-downs selectors.  The drill-down destinations are somewhat intuitive, meaning I probably should go to a mouse edit screen if I click on the eyeball associated with a given mouse record...But, the card selectors seem ambiguous in meaning.  Perhaps we could have buttons in the heading area which provide actions for selected cages.  What those buttons would do, however, is unclear.  I'm just speculating here.

And this is why we need to drive out a few more requirements.  Now, we may end up creating new tickets, but I think at the very least we should decide on some kind of title or heading text that describes the collection of cages.  FWIW, I will include the email thread I began Aug 7th.

{quote}Thanks!  I reviewed the text changes and they look great.  I have no great concern about constructing a new page.  My concerns only had to do with a conceptual tracking of where the user is.  In other words, there is currently nothing describing the page.  What the breadcrumbs will probably show for all cage maps, regardless of where one clicks, will be “HOME > CAGE VIEW”.  The URL will be {{host/CageView/Index}} or maybe {{host/CageView/Biopsy}} or something that would indicate the source of the navigational click.  I might be able to get the breadcrumbs to show “HOME > BIOPSY CAGE VIEW” or “HOME > MICE CAGE VIEW” or something similar.  I’d have to research this some more.

Hey these are really good questions!

A handful of answers:

•	Search Bar - @Carrie Leduc I believe there wouldn’t be a search bar on this view but I could be mistaken so I’ll defer to you.
•	Description of Parameters of Cage Collection – I’m not 100% sure I follow, but if you mean to show the filter/search criteria that led to that set of cages being displayed, then that’s something we haven’t discussed being present on screen.
•	“New cage grid view exists in its own view” – Yes this means a new page.  Do you have concerns about this?  
•	I think that 2nd bullet point suffered from some poor/hurried editing on my part when we last met to discuss these requirements and I was bouncing all over the text making changes.  I*think* I’ve got it right now, which was to actually delete that point discussing a toggle button, since a subsequent criteria specifies that there isn’t supposed to be a toggle button anymore, compared to our previous thinking on this ticket.  @Carrie Leduc, but please correct me if I’m wrong here.

If you have more questions/concerns, keep them coming.  If we need to jump on a call to discuss in more depth let me know.

Subject: COMA-2364 Issue

Folks, I think that there needs to be another round of driving out requirements on this ticket.  As I get into it, I realize that there is no actual description of the page, only a vague mention of a “light weight cage view”.  Is there a search bar?  Should there be a description somewhere of the parameters of the cage collection?  When the ticket says “the cage grid view exists in its own View”, that means I am designing a new web page, and the navigation will generally reveal very little—if anything—about where the page came from.

There is also some wording that needs to be clarified with the 2nd main bullet point under Acceptance Criteria.
{quote}","13/Aug/18 1:41 PM;jjensen;Another issue:

According to the Acceptance Criteria, it states in part:

{quote}o	If any mice that are shown in the list aren't currently in a cage, then the cage view won't show anything for those mice. If none of the currently listed mice are in cages, then the cage view should show the user a message saying there are no cages to display.{quote}

But, there is a case where this criterium makes no sense:  The Cages chart reports, in its first column, the number of cages with 0 mice in them.  This begs the question: what do we do about this condition?

I see two options here:
# Either remove the CGV link from the “cages with 0 mice” portion of the cages chart, or
# Show them anyway, since there may be a need to know which cages are empty.

In either case, the story needs to be edited.

FWIW, this is going to end up being the earliest blocker for me.  I can continue with making sure strains, mice, breedings, and litters all work with the CGV, but if we pick option “2” from the list, I will need to make a fundamental change to the SQL code and then account for 0-mice cages for the rest of the conditions.

I see a bug in this view, but I don't think its that the samples aren't showing (in fact, they probably shouldn't show in the plate in any browser). The bug I see is that the strains are collapsed.

The problem this print view is designed to solve is giving the mouse tech a way to manually fill in biopsy/well plate info (like the TAG center instruction card). I don't know what the use case would be for printing out a filled in well plate.

I should have picked up on this when I heard people talking about gradients and whatnot on the printout (which, to put that subject to rest, we have little to no control over (there is no way to determine in the browser what properties they are changing on the printing device)).

Lets discuss.

The IE doesn't show color in the well plates, but it does expand sample lists across strains and shows controls and omits in well plate.     [^PASSED - sample list expands across strains in print view - IE 11.pdf]

Litter Sample Validation Giving False Positives,COMA-2349,28842,23249,Rework,Testing PASSED,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,2 Important,,rwilliams,mbender,mbender,16/Feb/18 10:48 AM,08/May/18 3:24 PM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,,,CM - Release 1.1,,,0,,,,,,,,"-When a user adds a litter to the shopping cart needing a Biopsy/ID, once the user clicks on the ""ID"" icon the sample is then verified ALTHOUGH it has not been ID/Biopsied.  If the user cancels the Biopsy/ID the system still validates that it has been and will allow adding to cart, which then throws a hard error-

The latest QA push fixed the ID, but now the issue is with Biopsy. When a user goes to ID a litter, the system thinks it has been biopsied as well, even though it has not.

Steps To Recreate:
1. Add a litter to the cart that does not have a biopsy/ID (create new from breeding if needed)
2. Navigate to the cart and click on the ""ID"" icon next to the litter sample.
3. User will be taken to the litter workbench.
4. Add the ID for the litter's pups if not already ID'd.
5. Navigate back to the shopping cart.
6. User will see the litter is now validated and has the checkbox to add to an order.
7. User selects the litter and clicks ""start new order""
8. Hard error is thrown, see stack trace.

","20/Feb/18 9:42 PM;rwilliams;[~qevans] [~jmedlock] [~jcox] I think that there might be another reason for not being able to get a genotype – not knowing the sex of the sample when running for a sex-linked gene. This could happen because we didn’t run a Y probe and the mouse is not sexed in Colony. How would you like me to handle that scenario? I don't know that it is likely to happen often, but it could.","20/Feb/18 10:01 PM;rwilliams;[~qevans] [~jmedlock] [~jcox] Question dealing with ""Mosaic"". If the user selects the mosaic option the the Engine basically returns ""Mosaic"" instead of ""Impossible"" for Impossible results. Do I just need to not send back a reason for those scenarios? If there are no requirements for Mosaic right now I can hide the mosaic option for the time being. Nate brought up the mosaic option in our discussions on genotyping. This really may not be an issue the more I think about it because if the gene is marked mosaic, then the impossible results report back as mosaic instead of impossible. Since mosaic isn't impossible, I think the reason I return will just be empty and that should be fine.","21/Feb/18 8:19 AM;qevans;[~rwilliams] there aren't requirements around either of those scenarios right now, and I don't know that I can make an informed decision. I'm going to leave those up to [~jmedlock] and [~jcox].","21/Feb/18 8:37 AM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams] [~jcox] [~qevans] [~nnowak]  Additional thoughts?
In the case of the sex linked gene and not running a Y probe, i see a couple scenarios:

_For now_:
 *We should report inconclusive. Our policy so far has been that we will not a genotype report on partially run probes, the user will need to select it.*

_For the near future:_
*We will also want to check when the user adds a mouse/litter to the plate that is a sex linked gene and then turns off the Y probe or doesnot have the Y probe. We will want to alert them before the order is placed.*","21/Feb/18 9:40 AM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] [~qevans] [~jcox] [~nnowak] Jim, that's a great thought for the future. For now I am supposed to report back 1 of 3 reasons when I am not able to provide a genotype:
* Not all probes were run
* Results returned with an undetermined code
* Impossible results returned

So the question is, when we encounter the issue of not knowing the sex of the sample when running for a sex-linked gene, which reason should I return? It almost seems to me like there needs to be another reason added to the list for this particular scenario.",21/Feb/18 12:47 PM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams] [~qevans] Option 1. not all probes were run.,"21/Feb/18 1:41 PM;nnowak;Question. Are we planning to add (at some point) the ability to translate the result if they have sex of mouse filled out? This should be high on a list, as I imagine they will be annoyed that there is no genotype reported when mouse is known male/female.","21/Feb/18 1:52 PM;rwilliams;[~nnowak] The ResultsEngine is fully functional even for sex-linked genes, so that functionality you were asking about is already built in. The issue is that if the Engine doesn't have a Y probe result or a gender from Colony for a sex-linked gene, then the Engine is not able to calculate a genotype. 
My question is, for this particular scenario, which of the 3 given reasons do I need to show to the user as to why we were not able to return a genotype. My thoughts are that none of the 3 reasons fit this scenario. I think [~jmedlock] has suggested the best reason, if all we have are these 3 to choose from, is ""Not all probes were run"". I believe that you, Jeanie and Quincy came up with the list of the reasons. Here are the 3 reasons that I was given to report back for all scenarios where the Genotype cannot be translated from the results:
* Not all probes were run
* Results returned with an undetermined code
* Impossible results returned

Based on this information, what are your thought on adding a new reason for this particular scenario? This is only scenario that I have found that doesn't nicely fit into those 3 reasons.","21/Feb/18 2:13 PM;nnowak;Thanks Rich, now I understand. I agree, that if we are limited to those 3 reasons the ""Not all probes were run"". However, if we added another reason for this case it would probably help customers understand if we said something like: ""Sex of individual not indicated""","02/Apr/18 10:47 AM;qevans;Tested with COMA-2282: UND + impossible (screenshot-1) and not all probes were run (screenshot-2) are displaying help text correctly as well as in other combinations (screenshot-3, screenshot-4, screenshot-5).

+Acceptance Criteria+:
* As the mice are imported, if they have a parent ID, then create the necessary breedings and litters for mice that have the same parent IDs and birthday.  
* Any parents that have a death date should have their breedings retired.
* If we can't match the imported mouse Strain with an existing Strain, then error out to fallout table.
* If parent ID is present but doesn't match an existing Mouse, then error out to fallout table.
* Mouse IDs that we import have to be unique.
* [Todo] Required fields for Mouse, Litter, Breeding, Cage need to be identified and populated by input data, including default values.
* -{color:#d04437}Use the existing Notes table(s) to help the user understand data that was imported but is missing some data.  (for example, a mouse was added that didn't have parents listed){color}-
* If the user imports a mouse with a cage ID and that cage ID doesn't exist in our system, then we need to create that cage without room/rack info.  If the cage already exists then we just add the mouse to that cage.
* Add a flag on the Breedings, Litters, -{color:#d04437}Cages{color}- tables to indicate that records were imported through this process.
* Provides error handling when encountering bad data.  Bad data rows (errored out) are stored in a ""fallout"" table that is grouped by error type.  
* {color:#d04437}-Notifies user when import is complete.-{color}

+Notes+:
Order of precedence for creating Mice records:
* Start with Mice with blank Parent IDs
* Order by Birth Date and import Oldest to Youngest
* User can view Fallout table and make adjustments for reprocessing those rows.

+Scenario+:
*Given* I am importing mice with this process
*When* a mouse has a parent ID that doesn't exist,
*Then* it should go into the fallout table.
*And* If that parent ID is imported later on during the first pass of processing
*Then* a second pass of importing the fallout table rows will successfully import the original mouse now.

*** I listed IDs as possible alphanumeric strings, but this restriction is not necessary
*** I was unsure how to handle strains IDs (user created vs Transnetyx provided)
*** Strain names would be the names the user gives the strains, which may not be unique.
** From this list we can infer litters (same parents IDs) 
*** How will we infer litter name?

*** How will we infer breeding active status?
*** How will we infer breeding time?
*** How will we infer breeding name?

The user imports a table with animals and the parent records are there so it creates a breeding and litters with the animals in the table by birthdate. 
Later the user wants to import more records and this import contains another litter belonging to a breeding already in the system. If they list the parent ID's as they are in the system already will the import logic create this new litter under the previously created breeding or create a new breeding with same parent IDs? 
If it creates a new breeding, that is OK if we have a way to then search for those and / or alert and then adjust whatever they need to. (could be wrong parent IDs second time or could be they need to put under existing breeding in which case they could just create that litter in the system).

However, there were some litter records in the cage card, but each litter had zero pups and the same DOB.

FYI, I know you are out of town on vacation, so I am not expecting any response nor is this slowing me down.  I just wanted to give you a heads up since I will be out when you get back.",05/Jun/18 9:13 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] Good news. I looked into the mouse import issues you reported last week regarding 1) the dashboard not working and 2) the breedings and litters not showing up in the breeding and litter lists respectively. I had a bug in the import where is was not saving the offspring settings for the imported breedings and litters. Once I fixed that with a couple lines of code the dashboard worked and the breedings and litters showed up as expected in their lists. The litters are considered in-active because the litter has offspring and it has a weaned date.,"06/Jun/18 9:43 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] Yesterday I was finally able to look a little further into your reported issues, and the only thing left was the issue of seeing the litters from the import showing up in cages. Well, after I fixed the bug with the OffspringSettings not being created that I mentioned yesterday, these litters do not show up in cages. As far as I understand it, with the import, we are not creating litters unless they already have physical pups, and we are setting up the imported litter and pups as weaned, and therefore I would not expect to ever see an imported litter in a cage.","13/Jul/18 8:23 AM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], I looked over the acceptance criteria, and I believe your solution satisfies almost all of it!  There were a few things I saw that I wasn't sure about:

* _""Use the existing Notes table(s) to help the user understand data that was imported but is missing some data. (for example, a mouse was added that didn't have parents listed)_ {color:#14892c}""---*the Import2 UI handles this with Imported and Error column but not for the example given, which may not be the desired example anyway, since users may want to import mice without parent IDs.*{color}
* _""Add a flag on the Cages tables to indicate that records were imported through this process.""_{color:#14892c}---*I haven't looked to see if this is being done.*{color}
* _""Notifies user when import is complete""_{color:#14892c}---*Of course, the Import2 UI does this, but I am not sure if worker process will notify the import handler.*{color}

I feel that the Import Worker Process can be marked complete even with these.  Let me know your thoughts.

","13/Jul/18 8:43 AM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] In response to your final review of the acceptance criteria:
# While working through the creation of the mouse importer no one ever defined this feature, In hindsight I should have asked about it, but seeing that this never came up in our many discussions where we defined the desired functionality of the importer I would guess that it ended up not being something that anyone felt was important in the end. We did have some conversations early on about ""if we couldn't match the genotypes, maybe we should just add a note on the mouse"", but I think we worked through that and added rules and such that make the importer much more robust and complete to not have to add notes for things like no parents. If you find that there is a need for this then let's define it and add it.
# All of the pertinent entities that are created by the importer process have 3 new properties: IsImported, DateImported, and ImportedByUserId.  The specifications document (which needs to be attached to this ticket and old ones deleted), details each entity that is created and will also show these new fields that are associated with the import. In other words, I think we have this one covered.
# This criteria really should be part of a different ticket. This ticket defined the actual import processor which doesn't have a direct user interface.","13/Jul/18 12:53 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], I agree with each comment you made.

Some to-dos for me on this ticket are to 

# Tidy up ""specs spreadsheet"" (if needed) that you created and shared with me on Teams

No and no.
The user would be warned if the strain they are modifying is a Colony strain. However, regardless of whether they modify it or not, it will not affect an order already in progress. If they are intent on unlinking from the QO side, they just wont get any Colony results.

On the colony side, we're preventing the user from associating a target allele with a different probe while an order is in flight so that we don't give inaccurate results. If they break the link by removing probes in QO they wont get inaccurate results, they should just get no results.",23/Feb/18 8:39 AM;bwinter;[~admin]  Ah.  Thank you!

Another heads up is that the *ProbeArrived* order status is currently un-testable.  The only order statuses that can be tested are the following:

* *NotReceived* -> by clicking Submit on pricing page in Colony
* *Received* -> by finding order in ORMA and receiving it
* *InProgress* -> by using submitting this status from Testing Harness
* *PartiallyComplete*-> by using submitting this status from Testing Harness
* *Complete*-> by using submitting this status from Testing Harness
* *GenotypesAssigned* -> by assigning genotypes from Testing Results on Genotype Results page

","14/May/18 3:38 PM;admin;[~jcox]
Jeff, I spoke with Tyler about our preferred approach to handling litters without pups, which is to set a (new) DateTransferred column directly on the litter, and he sees no problem duplicating that functionality on the mobile client. 

The iOS application will need a ticket to account for this logic and handle the new property in its Litter getters, as well.
","17/May/18 8:55 AM;jcox;[~admin], is it safe to assume that DateTransferred would be set on the Litter record regardless of whether or not it has pups?  I get that this requirement we're discussing targets the use case where there are no pup records in the litter, but this feels like something we would just always populate when a litter is transferred.
","17/May/18 8:59 AM;admin;[~jcox]
Correct.
The logic for transferring a litter would be to set date transferred on the litter itself, and any mice of said litter.
","18/May/18 9:43 AM;jjensen;[~jcox] & [~admin]: the code does exactly what Chris said.  A new DateTransferred field in the Litter record is set upon transfer.  Additionally, any existing mice in the litter will also have their TransferDate set in the db record.

I could also use your help here.

Bryan’s testing says that this ticket fails when a breeding pair has one litter.  I think that the failure criterium is incorrect, due to the way that I test for litters:

                foreach (var parent in BreedingParents)
                {
                    if (parent.MouseId != null)
                    {
                        ParentLitterCount.Add(parent.MouseId, breeding.Litters.Count(l => l.IsActiveLitter && l.LitterParents.Any(lp => lp.MouseId == parent.MouseId)));
                   }
                }

As you can see in the code, I set up a Dictionary to use in the cshtml.  The Dictionary is filled with the parent id as the key and the number of litters where the parent is assigned.
Now, the _test_ comes from the Litter business object via IsActiveLitter.  Here is the definition:

        /// <summary>
        /// Common logic for determining whether or not a litter is ""active"".
        /// Note, that this is only accurate if we retrieve the litter's mice along with the litter.
        /// </summary>
        public bool IsActiveLitter => !this.DateDeleted.HasValue && !this.DateWeaned.HasValue && this.HasLivingOffspring;

Please note the comment which claims the Mice must be retrieved.

This is where I need help.

I don’t know where or how to retrieve the mice.

Granted, I could run the search for myself and maybe find it today, but I thought you might know where I could find the function or perhaps the best places where I should concentrate my search.

Once I load the mice into the litter object, the test should be accurate.

Can you help?

        /// <summary>
        /// Common logic for determining whether or not a litter is ""active"".
        /// Note, that this is only accurate if we retrieve the litter's mice along with the litter.
        /// </summary>
        public bool IsActiveLitter => !this.DateDeleted.HasValue && !this.DateWeaned.HasValue && this.HasLivingOffspring;

Please note the comment which claims the Mice must be retrieved.

This is where I need help.

I don’t know where or how to retrieve the mice.

Granted, I could run the search for myself and maybe find it today, but I thought you might know where I could find the function or perhaps the best places where I should concentrate my search.

Once I load the mice into the litter object, the test should be accurate.

Can you help?

","11/Jul/18 12:24 PM;jjensen;Chris, I changed the resharper thing, and then I manually reset only the items I saw in the comments (the two examples you gave).  Apparently, running the ctrl-a, ctrl-k, ctrl-d did not change the ones already done.  Of course, I only saw this after I committed and issued the pull request.  Let me know if reverting the cr/lfs is a necessity and I will address each item and issue another pull request.

","25/Jul/18 4:25 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], [~jcox] What is the expected behavior if a litter is transferred then the litter is weaned?  Should the weaned pups be able to be placed in cages?

CC: [~jmedlock]","25/Jul/18 4:29 PM;cleduc;[~bwinter][~jcox][~jmedlock] If a litter is transferred the mom must transfer with it (physically). If not, the litter transferred prior to wean must be being immediately euthanized. The only reason to allow weaning post transfer is for when they made a mistake and do it in the wrong order.  ","31/Jul/18 4:11 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], could you make a change to this ticket so that Transfer Litter action is not available from the Litter 3-dot menu in the Litter Workbench?

This is the place that is causing the problems.  This change will nullify this requirement, but I have crossed it out in the description with a note.

* User is able to mark a litter as transferred from 3-dot menu of the Litter Workbench.

 !litterworkbench3dotmenuforlitter.JPG|thumbnail! 

","31/Jul/18 5:27 PM;bwinter;Okay...  About the Transferring litters...  After a little more investigation, we discovered that this ticket is good to go if we simply remove these two requirements which allow transfer actions from the litter workbench:

* User is able to mark a litter as transferred from 3-dot menu of the _Litter Workbench_.
* User is able to mark individual pups as transferred from 3-dot menu of the _Litter Workbench_.

After talking to [~rwilliams], this is desirable anyway, because the litter workbench can work in conflicting ways.  For example, if you transfer the litter from the litter 3-dot menu while in the Litter Workbench, the litter workbench does not refresh or update or redirect.  Therefore, you can still make litter actions (id, biopsy, wean, etc) on a litter that was just transferred.  

Another example, if you transfer pups from the ""offspring"" 3-dot menu on the left-hand-side of the Litter Workbench, the ""rows"" in the Litter Workbench are not updated, therefore you can take litter actions against a pups you just transferred. 

However, transferring litter from the litter list works as expected.  The litter list is immediately refreshed; the litter is made inactive; and the litter no longer appears in the litter list unless you selected the ""active = false"" filter.

[~rwilliams] will remove the Transfer litter action from the litter 3-dot menu in the Litter Workbench, and we will be good to go. 

CC: [~cleduc], [~jcox], [~admin], [~rwilliams], [~jjensen]",31/Jul/18 5:47 PM;cleduc;[~bwinter][~rwilliams] thanks,"31/Jul/18 5:51 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], I made a mistake in my comment above.

When transferring litter from the litter list, the litter list is immediately refreshed, and the litter no longer appears in the litter list. 
 {color:#d04437}However{color}, selecting the ""active = false"" filter {color:#d04437}does not{color} show the litter again.

It is like the litter is neither active nor inactive from the litter list.  I cannot figure out how to get it to reappear in the litter list.  I can only find it in the breeding card.

{color:#d04437}More slightly bad news{color}, if you click the transferred litter from the breeding card, you are taken to the litter workbench where litter actions can be taken against the transferred litter.

All this seems low risk at the moment, but I wanted to give you the latest news.   Even having said all this, I have passed this ticket with the above caveats.  Let me know if this is not okay.

 !PASSED WITH RESERVATIONS - Litters can be transferred - 2018-07-31 17_53_09-.png|thumbnail! 

CC: [~jjensen], [~rwilliams] ","01/Aug/18 8:28 AM;jjensen;[~bwinter], after seeing what madness the filtering on these Kendo grid controls can become, I wouldn't put it past the litter filter to somehow contribute to your inability to view it after transfer.  However, your _{color:red}More slightly bad news{color}_ is significant, as it reinforces our belief that the original ticket missed the analysis boat.

In My Humble Opinion, we need to step back and see what needs to be done with Litters in general.  In other words, we need better analysis on a bigger picture.  I think [~cleduc], [~admin], and [~rwilliams] would agree that the awkward synchronization of states like _transferred_, _deleted_, and _weaned_ between the collections (litters) and the individual entities (mice) is proof of a poorly-implemented concept.","01/Aug/18 5:12 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter]  and any dev that might work on this in the future... when a litter is transferred we need to treat much like we do when we delete a litter. We need to transfer the mice, remove the mice from any cage they are in, and and possibly delete the litter parent records, and remove the litter from the cage it’s in.  
","01/Aug/18 5:24 PM;cleduc;[~rwilliams] - Thanks Rich, and also for anyone considering development on this, I think I'll be rewriting a new ticket(s) for this. Transferred means they did exist, they were moved out of the colony. No more actions can be taken but it is important to see their history and that they were transferred out and when. More on the new ticket eventually..","02/Aug/18 11:34 AM;bwinter;[~cleduc], I have assigned this ticket to you so that we can add more requirements to it.  When you are ready for that, we should move it out of TESTING FAILED and back to OPEN or ANALYSIS.  Let me know if I can help.

No, no debug code in there. You actually should not have been able to access the strain link wizard at all (as opposed to getting an error.)

Setting weaned dates correctly,COMA-2308,28778,,Bug,Staging,COMA,Colony Manager,software,admin,,,3 Standard,,mbender,jcox,jcox,29/Jan/18 2:42 PM,18/May/18 2:41 PM,04/Sep/18 11:00 AM,,,CM - Release 1.1,,,0,,,,,,,,"Somehow litters can get a wean date where the pups do not. IOS checks for adult mice on the cage map by looking at wean date on litter OR wean date on mouse. The web looks at mouse wean date only unless the mouse is already an adult, then how does web handle it? This is causing cage map counts for mice to appear off visually. 

2 things:
In staging and production we need to find how many litters have a wean date where the mice do not and discuss an update to those records.

We need to locate how this is happening where the  litter wean date is set but mice are not. We know the edits forms on both iOS and web will do this but there appears to be another location causing this bug.

the problem in October was that the iOS app wasn’t setting the Mouse.WeanDate at the time of weaning. It was just setting the Litter.DateWeaned. Now the iOS app is setting both dates at weaning (unless the mouse is a runt or dead).


FROM Jim:
* We have been discussing wean date on the edit form and its function. The edit form allows users to set the wean date and thus should apply that date to the pups. We need to change the edit form to allow this with a message above the states “Apply to all alive pups.” 
* Added by Rich: Then we need to update the back end so that anytime the wean date is set or updated, that the wean date for all eligible mice in the litter will also be updated to that same date. If wean date on the litter had a date and the user clears the date, then the date change would not be cascaded to the mice. (this functionality needs to be approved)
* The risk is pretty low that users will be editing wean dates after mice are in future breedings, etc, etc, Also we do not have any logic on the mouse level that prevents them from changing this individually.

Thanks!","30/Jan/18 10:34 AM;tposchel;I now remember that Rich asked me about ""manually setting the wean date on a litter"" a while back. The iOS app does NOT set the Pups[].WeanDate if the user manually sets the wean date on the litter. That could certainly be the bug.

So it sounds like web is moving forward with removing the ability to edit the wean date manually from the edit form? I suppose iOS should follow suit? OR we could attempt to modify each of the pups whenever the litter wean date is set?","30/Jan/18 11:37 AM;rwilliams;Useful Queries

If we fix the Genotype structure here, like fixing the way inconclusive is displayed, we need to fix that else where in the app. So it is consistent throughout the app.

This includes anywhere geneotypes or gene results may be displayed and can include inconclusive. The Mouse List is one place where genotypes are displayed and this can be changed. Another place is when the user assigns genotypes manually to a mouse, ""inconclusive"" is an option to choose. Should that now become the text that is specified to replace inconclusive? I think it should be the same throughout the application, but I am not sure if the user sees the Gen Name with the Null Zero icon (ban Icon) that they will know that means something like inconclusive.

If a user chooses ""inconclusive"" as the option to represent that gene result in the genotype, but the see the Gene name and the +*[ban icon|https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=tLNnWuDMIcuCjwOFn5W4BQ&q=ban+icon&oq=ban+icon&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l3j0i22i30k1j0i22i10i30k1j0i22i30k1l5.2002.4643.0.5033.10.9.0.0.0.0.150.919.0j7.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.8.1031.6..46j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i20i264k1j0i131i20i264k1j0i67k1j0i46k1j0i3k1j0i10k1.114.5fSHlbju7fI]*+ next to it, I am not sure that is intuitive for meaning the same thing. Also, that icon is used universally as the symbol for banning things (think of no smoking signs).

Also, I may run into trouble trying to stick that ban icon, or any icon, into the input drop down element. So could we stick to a more simple text solution, maybe something like *Gene Name <inconclusive>* (with inconclusive in superscript)?","23/Jan/18 4:35 PM;rjonakin;or I may be wrong, the ban symbol may be best to use here. Either way, I would like to change all instances of inconclusive everywhere in the site, for consistency.

This is the ticket that called out Semicolons in the genotype drop down list.

I still am unsure about the Icon usage in the gene result though, but I can try it and see how it works if that is what is wanted.","31/Jan/18 4:06 PM;rjonakin;wait - according to the specs in the description, no it says not to change the Inconclusive option, so I guess the Icon decision is no longer needed.
","01/Feb/18 9:33 AM;qevans;[~rjonakin] I think there may some confusion with that last bullet in the list. ""Inconclusive"" needs to show in the drop-down when it is expanded, but when collapsed it needs to be changed to the gene<null icon>. Those were the original requirements from Jeanie and Nate.

[~rjonakin], do the comments above make sense regarding how to implement gene<null icon> for the Inconclusive result?

","07/Feb/18 11:48 AM;rjonakin;[~jcox] [~jmedlock] [~qevans]

Jeff.
Yes, they make sense. I can do this.

I looked into the genotype drop down and I should be able to get that element working with this update as well. Like I was stating before, if we make this change for inconclusive in one place in the application, then I think it should be done everywhere, otherwise it could be confusing. So I will work on the drop down as well.

Another thing is that the ""Inconclusive"" gene result option *IS editable*. So this poses an issue. First, the way we would have to handle the Icon is different than how we handle the other gene results currently (including inconclusive). If we allow them to change the  result from the new Gene<Null Zero Icon> format, then the code will become very tedious and way more prone to breaking. I suggest if we make this change to showing Gene<Null Zero Icon> for inconclusive, then we make the inconclusive gene result immutable application wide. This will make the code around this feature a lot less brittle, and inconclusive will *always* look the same for every user and group in our application.","09/Mar/18 1:52 PM;rjonakin;[~jmedlock]

Add ""Help"" icon to the right of any row that displays an inconclusive genotype. Icon should be a question mark with hover text.
Hover text needs to display the reason the user is receiving an inconclusive genotype for a sample. It will be one of the three scenarios:
* Not all probes were run
* Results returned with an undetermined code
* Impossible results returned

Per Jordan's comment below, the hover text should have a bold header that reads:

*List of changes for this ticket - Rich*
* Dashboard Page
** Reworked the queries for the dashboard: simplified the EF query and eliminated a SQL call to a Ranges view
** Updated the queries for the counts/stats so that they use the same logic as the dashboard and the lists, specifically the Mice count and the Litters count.
**  Updated the Breedings part of the query to get it to ignore breedings without an Offsprings Settings record
** Created a post deployment script to soft delete breedings and litters that do not have an offspring settings record
* Strain Dashboard page
** Updated the queries for the counts/stats so that they use the same logic as the dashboard and the lists, specifically the Mice count and the Litters count.
* Add Breeding and Add and Edit Litter
** Modified the server side code so that when there is an error is trying to save any part of the data back to the database that the application throws and logs an error
** Also wrapped all of the processes for saving data to the database in a Sql Transaction. This will help with data integrity for these processes in the unlikely event that parts of save succeed and parts of the save fail for some reason.
* iOS Sync API for Strains, Breedings and Litters (and OffspringSettings)
** Rearranged some of the code so that for Strains, Breedings and Litters, there is a check to make sure that there is an corresponding OffspringSetting record for every entity to be created",,,,;08/Feb/18 3:21 PM;rwilliams;144000,;09/Feb/18 8:36 PM;admin;3600,,,,,,,,0,147600,,,0,147600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rwilliams,rwilliams,"{pullrequest={dataType=pullrequest, state=MERGED, stateCount=1}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""pullrequest"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":""2018-07-12T15:44:51.671-0500"",""stateCount"":1,""state"":""MERGED"",""dataType"":""pullrequest"",""open"":false},""byInstanceType"":{""bitbucket"":{""count"":1,""name"":""Bitbucket Cloud""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,admin,,,Unassigned,,bwinter,0|i00uk7:,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,,2018-02-08 21:23:59.205,08/Feb/18 3:23 PM;rwilliams;[~tposchel] When this ticket moves to QA I will need you to test it because I modified the iOS Sync API code.,"09/Feb/18 9:42 PM;rwilliams;[~tposchel] [~jmedlock] This change has been deployed to both dev and QA environments.

+Acceptance Criteria+:
* The Web Sync API includes syncing data in the following tables:
*# Orders
*# OrderWellPlates
*# OrderSamples


+Notes from Tyler+:

* The mobile client will need to fetch/GET these records via the normal DateCreated/DateModified/DateDeleted and GroupId filters.
* The mobile client will also need to be able to create/POST these record types as part of the sync process.
* The DTO objects for these record types will include the GUID (Gid) instead of the integer (Id)


Each of these tables has an integer based primary key. This is different than the rest of the database tables which use GUIDs for PK. To allow for the disconnected nature of the mobile device we must have a GUID on the row. To accomplish this, we are going to have both 'Id' (int, PK) and 'Gid' (uniqueidentifier) on each of these 3 tables. The mobile clients will only use the 'Gid', therefore, when processing sync data for these record types, the sync logic must search by 'Gid' to fetch the necessary relationships and then insert the appropriate 'Id' into foreign keys. 

+Scenario+:
* Sync data includes 1 Order (Gid ABC), 1 OrderWellplate (Gid DEF), and 2 OrderSamples (Gid GHI, JKL).
* The Sync data for the OrderSamples will include foreign keys (OrderWellplateGid = DEF, OrderGid = ABC).
* The web processing will have to first insert the Order (Id 222) to obtain an Id/PK, then insert the OrderWellplate (id 333), and then while processing the OrderSamples, fetch the appropriate Order and OrderWellplate by Gid, so that it can insert the OrderSample with the correct foreign keys (OrderWellplateId = 333, OrderId = 222).

From the notes that you provided and talking with [~admin] about specific limitations, I've pulled together 3 minor variations of a mockup.

Here are some comment/questions that I have:
# I'm thinking we might want to call this step Order Sample Placement. Thoughts?
# How does a user get to the Assay Options?
# If saving is a constant throughout the process, we may just want to take the Save button away and prompt the user that their changes have been saved with a success growler in the top right hand corner.","25/Jan/18 10:32 AM;tpatterson;I've added an additional drawing that shows a step we might want to take to better represent which wells the samples are sitting in. This was being accomplished in the original design, but with the various sizes that the wellplate coordinates take up, we might want to set this outside the mouse cell and give it a fixed width. This would still mirror Excel and separate location from sample. What do you think [~admin]?","29/Jan/18 9:04 AM;qevans;[~tpatterson]
1. I'm cool with whatever you guys want to name this page. Unless [~bwinter] knew something else when he created this ticket, I think he was just putting a suggestion out there to differentiate some of the wellplate views.
2. The Assay Options are opened when the user selects the cog/gear wheel underneath the strain name and above the samples.
3. I'm cool with success growlers- I think [~admin] had mentioned that's what he had in place. Once again, unless Bryan knew something else when he created this ticket, I think growlers are fine.","29/Jan/18 11:58 AM;bwinter;* *Breadcrumbs:* I agree with the name change for the breadcrumbs, but you may want to run it by Customer Support or Marketing to see what they call the ""add to samples to well plate"" step, so that we are consist there.
* *Save Button:* [~admin] are we auto-saving the well plate sample placements or does the save only activate after clicking the save button on the well plate UI?  If we are not, how difficult (by order of magnitude) would it be change it to auto-save?  And if auto save, when should success growlers pop-up?
* *Well Location:* [~tpatterson] Can you create a mock-up with some samples in the well and some not in the well?  I want to see your suggestion with and without placement.  It may be that well location in the strain color strip is easier to scan down. ","30/Jan/18 1:39 PM;tpatterson;* [~tpoley] & [~ryan yanase], would ""Order Sample Placement"" be an appropriate name for this spot? If not, what would you be a good name for this? (Please look at screenshots above to get a better idea of where this is)
* [~bwinter], please check out the updated mockups.
","30/Jan/18 2:45 PM;bwinter;[~tpatterson] Moving the well location to the outside is perfect!  Both elegant and functional!  Personally, I love it!","16/Feb/18 3:36 PM;bwinter;[~tpatterson]  Based on our conversations can you modify your mock-ups?

I can jump back on this tomorrow, if needed.","29/Mar/18 10:29 AM;bwinter;[~tpatterson] Yes.  Please jump back on this.  [~jmedlock] gave the go ahead to add this to 1.1. 

CC: [~jcox]","29/Mar/18 4:51 PM;tpatterson;[~bwinter], [~jmedlock], [~admin] - I've uploaded new mockups for everything.

After reading through the list of changes, there were a few modifications that I tossed in there, as well.
* ""Bulk Edit Probes"" > ""Edit Probes""
* Add help text near well plate id label that says ""Please enter a valid barcode for well plate #"" > Added ""?"" icon next to text field that can be clicked and a tooltip would popup.

Other bits of info:
* Icons used are from the Font Awesome Light package. This will be attached to this ticket soon.
* Light drop shadow should be applied to the following places:
** Samples card area
** Individual strain accordians / card areas
** Well Plates card area
** All buttons
* Medium drop shadow should be applied to the footer
* The footer should be sticky and have a higher z index than the Well Plates and Samples card areas

Chris, if you've got any questions or concerns about the choices that I've made design-wise, send me word. I'll be more than happy to help explain or correct possible issues.","29/Mar/18 5:15 PM;bwinter;[~admin] I have added you as the assignee for this ticket.

This is very confusing, I apologize. 2268 was referring to an issue when there is only one OM strain available, where as the issue I fixed was when there is only one mutation that needs linking. One deals with the first step in the link wizard and the other deals with the second step in the wizard. My bad.

We currently have prompting language for the user to link their strain inside the strain dashboard, but it assumes the group owner has already linked their QO account. The other scenarios we must consider are:
When the current logged in user is the Group Owner:

* Group owner does not have a QO account, and therefore cannot link on the account or strain levels. 
** Prompt user to register for QO.
* Group owner has a QO account, but has not linked on the account level. 
** Prompt user to link to their QO account.
*** If the Group Owners QO account is found to be disabled during the linking process, notify the user and instruct them to contact Customer Service
* Group owner has a QO account and has previously completed the linking process (current functionality)
** Display the existing strain linking UI cues to ALL group users. (current functionality)

Language to use has been provided by Todd and Jordan and is attached in the Word file on this ticket. In the situation where an ""a"" and a ""b"" text option is provided, they would like to know if we can do some A-B testing with the different versions of the text. If we can't easily support that, then we need to stick with the ""a"" option provided in the doc.

Upon sign-on and active group selection, evaluate the current users account status and display appropriate messaging based on criteria above.

Notes from dev:
* On looking up a user in OM to see if they have an account, we will be querying the OM Users table for the Group Leader's email address. There is an IsActive flag on that table that does enable/disable the user. I am going to modify the look up and the logic on the page(s) to handle if the user's account is there, but is inactive as well. Here is what I have on the the user's Account Management page when the user's account is InActive. The Support link pops up the SnapEngage chat client. !When QO User Account is InActive.png|thumbnail! 
* Also, I spoke the Jim, and for this implementation, if the current user is the leader of the group and the group is not currently linked to QO, then I will update the couple places on the Strain page so that the user is provided a link to their Account Group Management page. That page already includes most of the language and logic on it for handling the user and getting them signed up with QO and linked to QO.

* *_Current logic and Screenshots for a selected Strain (Strain Dashboard Page):_*
** If the current group leader's account is NOT linked to QO, Note that the Learn More button redirects the user to their Account Management (profile) page where the logic below applies based on who the user is an what state the account linking is in.

The ticket itself rightly talks about the Group owner and their QO account, however, the attached document provided only talks about the current user and their QO account. The document specifies that their be links for the user to sign up for QO or to link their account, but those scenarios/links are only applicable when the current user IS the Group owner. We need to also know what to do with the scenarios of when a user is NOT the group owner. 
Scenarios:
* Current User is Group Owner (The attachment covers these)
** Current user has a QO account, but it is not currently linked to their Colony Account
** Current user does not have QO account
* Current User is NOT Group Owner (The attachment doesn't cover these)
** Group user has a QO account, but it is not currently linked to their Colony Account
** Group user does not have QO account

In addition, there is  some language about ""a"" and ""b"" text options in the ticket. I see a ""1a"" and a ""1b"" in the ticket and I assume that is the a/b being referred to, but I don't understand what the difference is and when to use one versus the other. I just need some clarification on that. ","12/Feb/18 8:25 AM;rwilliams;[~rjonakin] Hey Russell, I need some assistance with writing a proper query to look up a Quick Order user via email to know whether they have an account or not. In Colony we want to be able to look up the Group Leader in QO to see if they have a valid and active account so that, if they aren't currently linked to QO, we can know whether to prompt them to link their account to QO or to signup for a QO account. I have this so far, I just need to know if there is more that I need to consider in my query.

Can any of you answer [~rwilliams]'s questions in his first comment?
Do we need separate language for users that are not the group owner? Or does the language provided in the document need to be modified?
Also, what needs to happen with the ""a"" and ""b"" text?","13/Feb/18 11:08 AM;admin;[~qevans] [~tpoley] [~jcox]

This ticket conflicts with an existing decision to not allow strain linking UI elements when the group owner has not linked their account. Displaying options on the strain level to every user wont have the desired effect, since the only account that matters is the group owners. This will undoubtedly cause confusion.

If we need advertising on the strain page that Account Linking is a thing, we need to build a story around that problem.

I may be a little confused so sorry for more than likely being naive. It was my knowledge that we scoped and built the free trial language to users on the unnecessary strain linking scenario.

Most of the changes to this story are about who see's what, when. The new functionality would be group owner only. The existing functionality would continue to be all users.

I have a feeling that we may want marketing to look at and possibly suggest some changes, but I think at this point we have all the data that we need to be able to modify this for pretty much however we want to handle this in the future. I have documented the way that I have it working above in the details of the ticket along with screen shots to make it easier to see and evaluate what I have done. There are two main parts to the changes, one is the changes made on the Strains Dashboard page, and those changes are pretty simple. The other is the Account Management (user profile) page, where all of the information and logic are intended to lead the user to get the automated genotyping setup.

If we're not good with what I proposed there, while it could pretty jarring, this might be a situation to use a modal. Either way these need to appear after the user has completed a task on the list and profile pages or after the user has clicked anything that allows them to navigate out of the workbench.","31/Jul/18 1:22 PM;jadhikari;[~bwinter] Should we consider allowing the user to keep or have an option to keep cages when mice(bulk) are marked dead ? Just like in the Mark Dead modal, we will have list of Cage with options Delete and Keep. I might be overthinking but wanted to see what you thought. 
","31/Jul/18 3:50 PM;bwinter;Great idea, [~jadhikari]!  I love it!  Let's ask [~cleduc]!

[~cleduc], when a user takes an action that removes mice from many cages, would you like the user to prompted to remove _all_ the cages or to have a _choice_ (via checkbox) to select which cages to delete?

As is, the requirements are to simply remove all cages (yes or no).  See scenario below.  The user cannot cherry-pick which cages to keep.  [~jadhikari] said it would take about a day more to allow the user to select which cages to keep (vs remove all cages if the user selects yes).

+Scenario+: _Prompt user to delete *many* empty cages using a modal_
*Given* _*many*_ cages have been emptied from selecting multiple mice in Mice List
*And* transferring or marking mice dead
*When* prompted to delete many empty cages
*Then* the prompt says ""Cages <Cage ID1, Cage ID2, ..., Cage IDN> are now empty. Would you like to remove these cages?""
*And* the user is given two buttons ""No"" ""Yes"" (in this order) to choose from

","31/Jul/18 4:30 PM;cleduc;[~jadhikari] [~bwinter] I went back and forth as I don't know the real reason to leave an empty cage - except to refill them. This would mean they are using them like positions. 
But since Cage name is not unique anyway, this seems OK to me. 
I do like the idea that they are presented with the list and can select all or just some and am fine with a one day add. 

But then, if Jwala is looking for a 1.2 ticket and there are none she fits with...we'll grab one of my other favorites like display cage room rack position on cull and other lists...:)","31/Jul/18 5:06 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], Roger that.  And thanks for taking my call to discuss more.  When [~jadhikari] gets to the part about prompting users to delete many cages, she will provide them with a check list to de-select which cages to NOT delete.",31/Jul/18 5:07 PM;cleduc;[~jadhikari][~bwinter] Nice! thanks so much Jwala!,"07/Aug/18 1:37 PM;jadhikari;[~cleduc] I feel that this ticket is getting larger and larger as I keep working on it since in involves showing the user prompt for any action done on mice/litter/breeding that might empty a cage. 
I was talking to Rich and he shared a few ideas so that we can make this ticket more manageable on both development and testing :
# Break the ticket into smaller chunks
# Have a global setting that will delete a cage by default when cage is empty (especially because it might be disruptive with modal on top of modals) 
Please let me know what you think. 
CC : [~bwinter]","07/Aug/18 1:45 PM;cleduc;[~jadhikari] I think having the global setting is fine. We just need to allow for a cage to exist empty - meaning when created, before mice are added.  
We can auto delete cages that had mice which are all now dead, transferred, deleted or moved. 

If we hit a use case for needing the emptied cage we will deal with it. 
We need to look at iOS for functionality matching.

Do we rewrite this ticket?
cc: [~bwinter]
[~jcox]","07/Aug/18 2:01 PM;jcox;[~cleduc], [~jadhikari], [~bwinter], I'm just catching up on this comment chain and I feel like the scope increase is significant.

* If we want a global setting that deletes cages by default, that's cool, but that itself is a separate ticket.  And is that part of 1.2 (needed for go-live)?
* Selecting *which* cages to delete after a bulk update seems like a story beyond prompting to delete all or none.  If that really is a ~1 day additional effort like a previous comment says then we include it if [~cleduc] is comfortable with it.  Otherwise that should probably be it's own story as well.  

And yes, we definitely need to make sure we're matching up with iOS.

Thanks,
Jim","19/Feb/18 3:14 PM;jcox;[~cleduc], [~jmedlock] and I were just discussing this ticket.  This is based on feedback from Veronica at UCSF and we're trying to figure out the problem that she's trying to solve with this suggestion. 

The complication with implementing the ticket as currently written is that we have a dynamically changing # of columns in our grid based on how many parents are included in the breeding.  

Could you help us better understand the problem so that we can come up with a more targeted solution?","20/Feb/18 9:02 AM;cleduc;The user wants a way to quickly evaluate what they have set up and how successful it is to determine what to set up next in order to achieve the genotypes they need.  

A few ideas:

* We put in one column where they see Expected Offspring Genotypes in a single column. 
* They click somewhere on the list and pop up all parents and their genotypes listed top to bottom.  
* We display genotypes next to the first two females and single male and beyond that would say view additional parental genotypes here...

A story:
Colony worker is asked to set up more breedings to produce more of a specific genotype. They want a way to view the genotypes of existing breedings to determine what they need to set up to fill the gap and to evaluate productivity by genotype to ensure they get their numbers.  They will use this view to determine what breeds well, large litters, and also what offspring genotypes to expect from the matings.","25/May/18 3:52 PM;cleduc;[~jmedlock], [~tpatterson]to cover the need right now, without a fancier tool can we 
* have a column for offspring strain 
* hover to display the genotypes of the parents",25/May/18 3:58 PM;jmedlock;[~cleduc] [~tpatterson] they want separate columns so they can sort and filter. If they are looking for breeders rearranging the breeding should help with this also. The current design of the breeding list is not friendly with this request. They want to see them all in line sort and filter the list by these columns.,"25/May/18 5:53 PM;tpatterson;Without us attempting to redesign the list / table paradigm (one filterable item per cell) and since the user is wanting to filter multiple sets of data, I think that this problem could be solved by having the user drill into a breeding page that could easily display the genotypes applied to each parent. Also, we really want to stay away from important information being displayed in tooltips / popovers that aren't accessible on mobile devices.",29/May/18 8:34 AM;cleduc;[~tpatterson] [~jmedlock] Ted - when you have some time lets talk about it and then we can propose something to Jim (assuming Jim doesn't have time to talk with us)?,29/May/18 9:00 AM;tpatterson;Sounds good [~cleduc]!,"30/May/18 9:50 AM;tpatterson;After talking with [~cleduc], we may want to create a set of columns that focus in on dam and sire IDs and genotypes. It could be as simple as allowing users to view ""Dam 1 ID"" column, ""Dam 1 genotype"" column, ""Sire 1 ID"" column, ""Sire 1 ID"" column, etc. Now, with harem breedings in mind, we might want to offer up the option of displaying another set of columns that would show information on a second dam or sire. In addition, if there was more than one dam or sire, we might want to place an indicator ( ""..."" or ""collection"" icon) that speaks to the fact that there is more to see.

Two examples of different scenarios is listed below:

There are more than one dam ID and genotype, but it currently not being shown:
||Mouse ID||Dam 1 ID||Dam 1 Genotype||Sire 1 ID||Sire 1 Genotype||
|[ID]|[ID][...]|[Genotype][...]|[ID]|[Genotype]|

There is more than one sire genotype and ID. They are both being shown:
||Mouse ID||Dam 1 ID||Dam 1 Genotype||Sire 1 ID||Sire 1 Genotype||Sire 2 ID||Sire 2 Genotype||
|[ID]|[ID][...]|[Genotype][...]|[ID][...]|[Genotype][...]|[ID][...]|[Genotype][...]|

Is there anything that would throw a wrench in this approach? [~jmedlock] [~rjonakin]

+Acceptance Criteria+:
* Genotype sort order is consistent across all locations in both iOS and web apps.
* The gene order is alphabetized by gene name.
* Order alphabetically by gene name, then by zygosity, then by mutation name within zygosity.
* Zygosity = Homozygous -> Heterozygous - > Wild Type -> Inconclusive


+Examples:+
_First Gene_
_Trp53<brd>_ *First mutation*
_Trp53<tg1234>_  *second mutation*

_Second Gene_
_APC<min>_ *first mutation for APC*

+Genotype Order Examples:+
APC<min/min>
APC<min/WT>
APC<WT/WT>

Trp53<Brd/Brd>
Trp53<BRD/tg1234> *mutant1/mutant2*
Trp53<tg1234/tg1234> *second mutation*
Trp53<Brd/WT>
Trp53<tg1234/WT>
Trp53<WT/WT> *wild type/wild type*
Inconclusive *Always last*


+This change affects:+
* The strain dashboard genotype cards
* The genotype view for adding genotypes to:
* multiple mice from the mouse list
* pups on a litter
* The genotype drop down list on the add mouse form/Edit mouse form

","11/Dec/17 9:39 AM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], in iOS | QA, to add *existing* mice to a cage from the _cage details_ modal, the user can follow these steps:

# from Dashboard, click Cages button > user taken to _Cage List_
# from _Cage List_, click ""Add Mice"" button on desired cage > _Actions_ modal pops up
# from _Actions Modal_, click ""Add Existing Mice"" button > a _Select Mice_ modal pops up with *auto-filter* for _alive_ mice _without a cage_.
# from _Select Mice_ modal, select a mice from auto-filtered list or change filter to find desired mouse.","17/Jan/18 1:32 PM;tpatterson;[~jmedlock] & [~bwinter] - Since this could be a potentially confusing process, I'd recommend that if the user selects ""Add Existing Mice"" they are taken to another page where they are presented a limited view of the Mice List. From here they could select, deselect, filter, search, and (at the bottom of the page) save or cancel. Also, it would be extremely helpful on both platforms to see how many mice you've selected and, if it's possible, easily see which ones have been selected. Like I mentioned this is where a user may get lost or forget which mice they've selected, having some way to display the collection of mice they're currently considering to add to the cage would takes pressure off the user and keep them moving forward.","17/Jan/18 2:56 PM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], I second [~tpatterson]'s comment.

[~tpatterson], did you see the attached screenshots below from iOS? What would you keep and change about them to fit your idea?

!IMG_0005.PNG|thumbnail! 
!IMG_0006.PNG|thumbnail! 

[~tpatterson], correct me if I am wrong:  the UI for this card would require these 3 items below.

* use a page for mice selection (as opposed to modal view)
* show count of mice selected
* visualize mice selected---I think this is done in iOS with the left-hand column of circles which are filled when you select a mouse
","17/Jan/18 3:30 PM;tpatterson;I did see those and you've definitely bulleted out what I suggested. I think that the iOS would also benefit from taking the user to another screen and having all real estate set aside to take the user through the adding process. With this approach, we'd have space to allow users to select mice, inform how many are selected, visualize which mice are selected and, finally, ""map"" or ""add"" mice to the cage. The only difference between what is currently being done (the users seeing the circle selections) and this last addition that I presented is that once a user has scrolled down enough or started another search, those selected mice will be out of view and could be forgotten or hard to find again. To keep our real estate in check, I think that a ""Currently Selected"" filter could help people quickly bring all their selections back into view again. I still think that this feature may be too hidden for most people to logically find it, but it could be a good first step.","07/Feb/18 4:48 PM;tpatterson;I've attached 2 mockups of some potential options for the add mouse to cage view. Clarification: the x icon would be used to clear all selections and the check icon could be used to only show currently selected mice. I'm not quite sure if using the check option is the best route, but the alternative would be to just include ""view selected"" and ""view all"" under filters. Thoughts?","21/Feb/18 1:46 PM;jcox;I've modified this story to be in line with the discussion we had during story estimation.  There is a new screenshot included of the existing UI for adding breeding parents, which is to be used as the template for the new page detailed by this story.","10/May/18 3:54 PM;jadhikari;[~jcox] [~tpatterson] Do we know what columns we want to show in the cage free mouse grid?

Jwala I think we can go simple an reuse the fields that iOS displays on the mouse cell in the above screen.
I believe they are:

Mouse Age, Gender, ID if present, Strain, Genotype, Owner initials, Labels.

[~cleduc] all of these required to identify a mouse? Can we limit to Age, gender, strain, genotype?

If possible, owner initials and labels would be helpful because the technician can receive one shipment of a strain and then be required to divide the animals based on the researcher and experiments. ","25/Jun/18 11:57 AM;bwinter;[~tpatterson], On Feb 7, you commented in this ticket that you attached 2 mock-ups, but I don't see them attached.  Probably too late now, but I just wanted to double-check if you still had them or not.
","25/Jun/18 11:58 AM;bwinter;[~cleduc], one of the acceptance criterion for this ticket was to have sort-able columns for the Add Existing Mice modal.  Is that still desired?","25/Jun/18 12:00 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc] Also, do you want the modal to be wider if the screen allows it?  Right now, it seems like the modal will only stretch so far which makes the Genotype and Strain hard to read.

 !zzz - Does modal need to be wider if screen allows it.png|thumbnail! ","25/Jun/18 12:02 PM;tpatterson;[~bwinter], I'm not quite sure where they are, as well. I'm going to stop by your office at some point and we'll look through the T Drive together. While the mockups will be dated, they may provide some directions.","25/Jun/18 12:03 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], Sorry.  One more thing.  Two more acceptance criteria were the following:

* By default, the existing mice list should be filtered to only show mice that are not currently assigned a cage.
* User can modify the filter to include mice that are NOT already assigned to a cage.

The first one appears to be met, but the latter does not, which means that users will NOT be able to use ""Add Existing Mice"" feature to add mice that are in another cage.  It will only work for mice not yet assigned to a cage.
","25/Jun/18 1:00 PM;cleduc;[~bwinter] [~tpatterson]Hi! Let me know if I miss any questions.  

_By default, the existing mice list should be filtered to only show mice that are not currently assigned a cage._ - Yes.

_to have sort-able columns for the Add Existing Mice modal. Is that still desired?_ - Desired but I am willing to fly without it first pass. I vote to create a ""upgrade to Adding Existing Mice Feature"" ticket and add this functionality to that ticket.

_do you want the modal to be wider if the screen allows it? Right now, it seems like the modal will only stretch so far which makes the Genotype and Strain hard to read._ - If easy OK, if not, put in ""Upgrade to..."" ticket

_User can modify the filter to include mice that are NOT already assigned to a cage._ - Stick this in the ""upgrade to"" ticket also, although this is nice, it should not hold up the ticket as they can, and probably should, do this in the workbench.","25/Jun/18 2:30 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc],  I added these features to COMA-2625.   

[~tpatterson], when we get the chance, we should add the mock-ups to COMA-2625 instead of this ticket.","08/Jul/18 10:48 PM;bwinter;[~cleduc], [~jmedlock], I am passing this ticket.  Users can now add existing mice to cage from the Cage Map for mice not already assigned to cage. Great job, [~jadhikari]!  

I noticed that the add existing mice to cage does not work as expected when using this feature from the Cage Workbench.  The mice are added to the cage, but you cannot visually see the mouse records until you leave the Cage Workbench and go back to the Cage Map.

I will put in a bug ticket for this and assign to Unplanned: COMA-2631",,,,,,,,

Mice form has all required elements and creates new mice records in both locations (Dashboard > Mice Panel; Cage Map > Cage icon).

+Acceptance Criteria+:
* User can multi select mice on the mouse list and select to change the status to ""transferred"" rather than one at a time. 

* When a user transfers one or more mice from the Mice List, those mice are marked as transferred and no longer show in the default filtered view of Mice List or any assigned cages.
* When a user transfers a Mouse from a Mouse Record 3-dot menu, then that mouse is marked as transferred and no longer show in the default filtered view of Mice List or any assigned cages..
* When a user selects bulk transfer for a cage, all *mice* are marked as transferred (removed from cage) and no longer appear on the 
** Cage Card or 
** Cage Icon of the Cage Map List.
* When a user transfers mice, mice counts for strains, breedings, litters, and cages should be accordingly decremented (where applicable).


+Scenario 1+: _Selecting mice from Mice List to transfer_
*Given* I am in the Mice List view
*When* I select one or more mice
*Then* I am shown a transfer button in Mice List Action Toolbar

+Scenario 2+: _Transferring mice_
*Given* I have selected one or more mice from Mice List
*When* I click the transfer button
*Then* selected mice are marked as transferred
*And* no longer show in default filtered view of Mice List
*And* no longer show in assigned cages (if any)

+Scenario 3+: _Filtering Mice List on transferred status_
*Given* that I have transferred several mice
*When* I filter Mice List on mice marked transferred
*Then* I am shown the transferred mice

+Scenario 4+: _Selecting Transfer option from a Mouse Record's 3-dot menu_
*Given* I have selected Mouse Record from {{<view>}}
*When* I click the 3-dot menu for a Mouse Record
*Then* I am presented with an option entitled ""Transfer""

+Examples+:

| {{view}} |
| {{Breedings > Parents Group}} |
| {{Breedings > Offspring Group}} |
| {{Litters > Parents Group}} |
| {{Litters > Offspring Group}} |
| {{Mice > Mice Details}} |
| {{Cages > Cage Card}} |

+Scenario 5+: _Transferring one Mouse at-a-time from Mouse Record's 3-dot menu_
*Given* I have selected the 3-dot menu of a Mouse Record
*When* I click Transfer
*Then* that selected mouse in the cage is marked as transferred
*And* I am presented with a prompt to chose a transfer date 
*And* the selected Mouse Record is removed from default filtered {{<view>}}.

+Examples+:

| {{view}} |
| {{Breedings > Parents Group}} |
| {{Breedings > Offspring Group}} |
| {{Litters > Parents Group}} |
| {{Litters > Offspring Group}} |
| {{Mice > Mice Details}} |
| {{Cages > Cage Card}} |

+Scenario 6+: _Selecting Bulk Transfer option from a Cage's 3-dot menu_
*Given* I have selected cage from the Cage Map
*When* I click the Cages 3-dot menu
*Then* I am presented with an option entitled ""Bulk Transfer""

+Scenario 7+: _Bulk transferring mice from a cage_
*Given* I have selected a cage
*And* I have selected the cage's 3-dot menu
*When* I click Bulk Transfer
*Then* all the Mice in the cage are marked as transferred
*And* all the Litter Records are marked as transferred
*And* I am presented with a prompt to choose a transfer date
*And* the cage is empty for Mice Records and Litter Records

+Scenario 8+: _Prompt user to select transfer date_
*Given* I have selected to transfer mice and/or litters
*When* I am prompted to select transfer date
*Then* the prompt says ""Select transfer date""
*And* the prompt shows a date-picker
*And* the prompt gives two button ""Cancel"" and ""Save""

+Scenario 9+: _Click anywhere outside of modal prompt_
*Given* I am prompted to select transfer date
*When* I click anywhere outside of the modal prompt
*Then* I am taken back to the previous view
*And* the Mice or Litters are not transferred

+Scenario 10+: _Click Cancel to select transfer date_
*Given* I am prompted to select transfer date
*When* I click Cancel from the prompt
*Then* I am taken back to the previous view
*And* the Mice or Litters are not transferred

+Scenario 11+: _Click Save to select transfer date_
*Given* I am prompted to select transfer date
*When* I click Save from the prompt
*Then* I am taken back to the previous view
*And* the Mice or Litters are transferred with transfer date equal to date selected from transfer date date-picker

+Scenario 12+: _Decrement Mice/Litter count after transfer_
*When* I transfer a mice or litters
*Then* the corresponding mice / litter counts are decremented accordingly across strain, breedings, cages, and litters (where applicable).

We have some conversations going on with [~rwilliams] and [~bwinter] regarding the definition of transferred. I think all is clear for this ticket but would be good to touch in. 
Transferred means animals are no longer in the colony. No more actions can be taken on them (like deleted mice) but they can be seen if we filter to see them (unlike deleted mice). 
 ",03/Aug/18 11:12 AM;rwilliams;[~cleduc] [~bkoch] [~jjensen] [~bwinter] I would rope in Bryan and Jamie into any conversation on this because the other transfer  litter ticket has been stopped in its tracks to be reevaluated.,"06/Aug/18 10:31 AM;bkoch;[~rwilliams], [~jcox], should we have a quick call to talk about this?

This is fine for some users but not ok for other users, such as UCSF.

To accommodate multiple users and different scenarios for use of the mouse ID, we need to implement a system mouse ID that is unique and user friendly. This system mouse ID can be unique across a colony or across the system. (Developer decision)

We need to display the system mouse id:
Mouse record
Mouse mini card
Mouse list
Add mouse form - non-editable

Acceptance Criteria:
System Mouse IDs are assigned in these Add features:
* _Add mouse from Cage Details_
* _Add Mouse from Dashboard_
* _Add pup from litter workbench_
* _Pups generated from litters_
* _Import Mouse_
* _User can set starting ID from offspring settings_

This is still an issue, so I am going to reopen.","14/Jan/18 6:13 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] I found how the cage map filtering is working, so the next the question is, how should we be determining what an ""Acitve Litter"" is? If you agree that this logic is correct, then the second question is, why do we think that some of the cages in the screen shots should be included in the Active Litters filter? 

The current logic for determining whether a cage is filtered as having active litter(s): 
{code:c#}
this.HasMice = (cage.Mice != null && cage.Mice.Any())
this.HasLitters = cage.Litters != null && cage.Litters.Any();bool 
hasUnweanedMice = this.HasMice ? cage.Mice.Any(x => x.LitterId.HasValue && !x.WeanDate.HasValue) : false;
this.ActiveLitter = HasLitters && hasUnweanedMice ? ""Active Litter"" : ""Not Active"";
{code}
This is basically saying that a cage has to have litters and at least one unweaned mouse.

PS. As I look at this, I am looking at the cage map and I see excluded cages that I think we are saying should be included. I opened up the details of one of those cages and sure enough it shows that it has an active litter in the cage that has 3 pups in this case, but the reason why it was excluded from the filter is because all of the mice in the litter are weaned. I haven't looked at the logic yet of why a litter shows (or doesn't show) in a cage itself but I think what we have is a difference in the logic between these two things. Let me know your thoughts when you have a few minutes. Thanks!!","14/Jan/18 8:20 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] After a little digging into what constitutes an ""Active"" litter on the Cage card I see that it is a Litter that is not deleted and that has not been weaned yet. This is different logic than what constitutes a cage having an ""Active"" litter for the filter on the Cage Map. The Cage Map filter only looks at the mice in the cage for a wean date and doesn't consider whether or not the litter has a wean date. So you tell me how this should work. Assuming that the Active Litters listed in the cage is correct, then should the logic for determining ""Active"" litters on the cage map be changed so that it ONLY looks for unweaned litters and DROP the check for mice in the cage being unweaned? This is an easy fix, but I just need to know exactly how to handle that little bit of logic. It seems to me that the mice in the cage shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not the cage has ""Active"" litters in it.","15/Jan/18 11:34 AM;rwilliams;[~tposchel] Question on the iOS logic for determining Active Litters as described in the body of this ticket. Point 3 talks about a litter being considered ""Active"" if it has 1 or more live pups. I think we may be missing something here because if we were to change the web app to include this case I believe that there will be many many more litters that will suddenly become ""Active"". I am thinking that we are missing something here. Currently on the web app we determine if a litter is ""Active"" solely by making sure that the litter hasn't been weaned. So, whether a Litter has generated pups or not, we look to see if the litter has been weaned to determine if it is active. Based on the logic in iOS, it looks like a litter is active for as long as there are live mice that came from that litter. [~jmedlock] [~jcox]","15/Jan/18 11:58 AM;tposchel;I spoke with Rich about this and we're all cleared up. iOS does check DateWeaned first and foremost to determine if a litter is active.

Also, a mouse could be deleted or marked dead (or culled) and do the same thing. So, even if we add constraints to not allow this on the edit breeding page, you can't stop it from happening in other round-about ways. Another thing is that a user could wipe out the active date, save it, remove a mouse, and then possibly mark it active again.

The app should handle the mouse delete instance as well. If a mouse is being deleted for any reason and is tied to breedings, litter parent records etc. We should warn the user. Then we can remove it from breeding and litter parent records. We may want to make sure we handling the scenarios you mentioned in addition to adding in these checks and balances to removing breeding parents.","04/Jan/18 2:59 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] I would have to look into the code to see what exactly is happening when a mouse is marked dead or deleted. I also don't know off the top of my head if any of the places where you can do these types of tasks if there is any check or warning to the user that the mouse is in a breeding. I seem to recall at least one place where it shows active breedings for the mouse and asks how you want to handle those, but that is just a faint memory. And I think I have a memory of it because I built the UI for it.  I remember that it was a list of check boxes and date pickers, but I don't remember if that was for deleting a mouse or retiring a mouse or marking a mouse dead.

When there are litters attributed to a breeder:
# Disable the close button and warn the user from the beginning.
# Disable the close button, present a question icon, and inform the user after pressing the question icon.
# The process is mostly unchanged. After a user has clicked on the delete icon, a warning will be presented.

I've also attached an html document with the code used to make these variations. To check this out in your browser - open to this page in Colony, inspect, and replace everything within the <html> section with the 1889.html code.

After building these out, I'm thinking that option one may be too shocking and option three is frustrating. Option two could be a good balance between the two - passive and informative.

","13/Feb/18 1:15 PM;tpatterson;Thanks for the language and UX input [~cleduc] & [~admin].

Tossing in an option to help users retire from this location would be extremely useful. Hopefully with the shift to record pages, our users would only see this wizard when creating something new and the retire options would be within close reach while editing from the breeding record page or the mouse record page.

Now, after some thought, with the fact that this fix will not be the norm forever and that there's already a standard of displaying errors when something is out of order above the list area, I'd suggest we merge the first & second designs and possibly (per [~jmedlock]'s idea) allow the user to see specific active litters it is connected to when they interact with the question icon.

","11/Jul/18 11:23 AM;jjensen;[~cleduc], I have to ask you about the ""litter status"" as defined in this particular ticket.  The text is a bit confusing, but I believe what the story _wants_ to say is: _Once a breeding has *at least one un-deleted litter*, the parents should not be able to be removed_
This is different from any active/inactive status that I might check in the code.  Can you please make a judgement call on this?

","11/Jul/18 11:33 AM;cleduc;[~jjensen] If a litter has been recorded for a breeding and has not been deleted, the user cannot change the parents. 

They can Retire (which means it is no longer physically in the breeding at this time) but not remove/change them (which would change the record regarding who was there). If they have realized they have made an error in parent recording after a litter has been recorded they need to contact us to do something custom to fix the data. If they are taking one parent out and putting in another breeding, they retire from this breeding and create a new breeding with the moved parent.","11/Jul/18 11:37 AM;cleduc;[~jjensen] I actually wrote that comment before I saw your question above it!

These mice are getting assigned a name when they get generated. If you don't want dead or missing mice to get auto Ided like that (meaning you want the ID to be left blank), then I can put in some code that to not auto name the mouse if the mouse is missing or dead. One side effect that could have is that it wipes out the mouse's name if it gets marked dead or missing later in life. I'll have to see if I can code that so it won't do that. But, once I get that done then we will see what the litter workbench actually does when you ID the mice. Let me know if you want me to remove that auto naming code for dead or missing mice. ",12/Jan/18 8:50 AM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] This may also be revealing an issue with the system generated id. It doesn't appear to be handling the unique naming of mice when multiple are created at the same time,"12/Jan/18 10:13 AM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] Actually as I look through the code, the name field is getting populated with System Generated Id of the mouse if the name field is empty. Do we not want to do that for mice that are missing or dead? So what that means is that when the mice were ""generated"" the system assigned them a SysGenId, then, when the LitterWorkbench loads the newly generated mice back up (missing and dead ones too), because the name is empty, our code automatically fills it in with the mouse SysGenId. We really need to talk through how all of this should work. And we have also discovered a bug with the SysGenId where it appears that it isn't incrementing for some reason... 

Thinking through this a little more... I think that because of the way the application works right now with the name auto filling with the SysGenId that the Workbench will never ID mice like it should because I think it would only ID mice that didn't already have a name, but right now they will always come back with a name. I think we need to talk through this some with Chris to determine how we really want some of this to work. And I am making some assumptions on how the Workbench works, so I may not be right on all of that...",12/Jan/18 10:31 AM;jmedlock;[~rwilliams] We would not want an ID on missing or dead pups if they were marked as such before pups we generated. The feedback comes in before we added in the system ID though. We may want to discuss this. The feedback is that they do not want those records taking up the next in line auto serialized ID. That is different than the system ID.,"12/Jan/18 12:37 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] I've made some changes to the name so that it doesn't automatically populate for mice that are dead (or missing). Now the mice are showing in the workbench without a name and the name is disabled so that it can't be edited. All of that is good, however, the live mice are still coming in with the system generated id for the name and I think that the process of automatically naming the mice doesn't do anything because the live mice already have a name assigned. I may be able to clear that name as the mice go back to the workbench and see if that resolves the id issue there, but not sure what will happen if they aren't ided during that session and are saved, because the sysgenid may still slip in there somewhere in the process... I'll keep working and let you know what happens.

Also, I have already mentioned this, but we apparently have a bug with the sysgenid as well because it isn't getting auto incremented. I'll look into that while I am here to see if I can figure out what is going with that too.",12/Jan/18 3:50 PM;rwilliams;[~jmedlock] I have fixed the Mouse System Generated Id so that it increments properly.

For all 3 scenarios *Unknown should always be the last option in the list*

From this form can we change the mothers location to a drop down.

For 1 mother breedings:
The drop down should have the mother selected by default, present the user with an unknown option as a second option.

For trio breedings:
Have the mother that was in the cage where the add litter option was selected be the default.
Other options:
* Unknown
* Both mothers in the breeding
* The other mother
For Harem breedings:
Have the mother that was in the cage where the add litter option was selected be the default.
Other options:
* Unknown
* All other mothers in the breeding","27/Oct/17 8:12 AM;bkoch;[~jmedlock], so you are saying we want to get rid of the ability to add mothers to the list in a per mother basis, and instead just give the user the options you've listed, depending on the breeding type?  For your new dropdown options, I think I need a little clarification:
 - if multiple mothers are in the same cage for the trio or harem, which one should we pick for the default selected?
 - Since we aren't limiting the selection of mothers based on if the user selects trio, harem, etc. should we go on the number of mothers selected?
 - If this isn't the case, and we do want to go based on the breeding method, what should we do for ""special"" and ""unknown""?
 - For Harem breedings, you are meaning that you want every mother listed as a separate option, with the one in the cage being selected by default? 

I guess currently I think it makes it the easiest and most straight forward for the end uesr is that you can select any one of the mothers in the breeding whether or not they are in the cage that you add the litter to, and maybe we can just add an ""unknown"" option to that list.   Maybe we can talk about this a little bit right after scrum?","27/Oct/17 8:51 AM;jmedlock;* if multiple mothers are in the same cage for the trio or harem, which one should we pick for the default selected?
     The first one in the list of mothers is fine.
* Since we aren't limiting the selection of mothers based on if the user selects trio, harem, etc. should we go on the number of mothers selected?
    If number of mothers = 2 the option for both mothers (dam 1 and dam 2) should be in the drop down list. 
* If this isn't the case, and we do want to go based on the breeding method, what should we do for ""special"" and ""unknown""?
    Your statement below is accurate. The only outlying scenario is the trio where both mothers need to be able to be selected at the same time. 
    For single mother breedings the 1 mother should be selected or have the unknown option.
For Harem breedings, you are meaning that you want every mother listed as a separate option, with the one in the cage being selected by default?
I guess currently I think it makes it the easiest and most straight forward for the end uesr is that you can select any one of the mothers in the breeding whether or not they are in the cage that you add the litter to, and maybe we can just add an ""unknown"" option to that list. Maybe we can talk about this a little bit right after scrum?","02/Nov/17 7:32 AM;bkoch;[~jmedlock] [~admin], while looking into this, I'm sort of wondering how we can implement it.  I thought at first (and implemented) a way for an unknown mother to be added to the cage on add litter detail load with just the name as ""unknown"" and the id as ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"", but then when saving the litter it has to validate that mouse is in the system, and goes through the typcial business logic validations.  So my question would be:

1. Should we keep dynamically generating this unknown mouse for each time they want to add a litter, and therefor there are litters with mothers who don't exist in the system?
 - Benefits here are that we don't clutter up the mouse list with unwanted mice, but the negatives are that we'd have a lot of potentially broken references.
2. Should we create a new physical mouse entry with the name ""unknown"" and the same properties as the next mother mouse in the list?  
 - Benefits are that we are following the same business logic as every other litter and breeding goes, but will create a lot of potentially unwanted mice in the system.
3. Should we not do the unknown option, and just go back to the main point of making sure we create the litter in the cage that it was selected from?

or is there a different option I'm not thinking of?","02/Nov/17 8:56 AM;jmedlock;[~admin] [~bkoch] After looking through some other tickets and seeing the difficult time you are having, it appears we made the litter mother required somehow in the business logic. Having it required makes things easier for us but may cause issues for users that have no idea which mother the litter came from, scary but that appears to be a thing.

Is that an accurate assumption that the litter mother parent seems to be required in the business logic?

Thanks,
Jim

","06/Nov/17 4:28 AM;bkoch;[~jmedlock], it looks like this isn't an issue anymore.  The steps I tried to take to reproduce this:

1. Added a new breeding with 3 mothers and 1 father to a cage.
2. Moved 1 of the mothers to a different cage.
3. Added a litter, verified that all of the mothers were still displayed correctly (even the one that was moved to a different cage).
4. Used the mother from the seperate cage to create a litter, verified that it was created in the cage that was selected to be added from.

One thing I have noticed is that as mentioned previously, the breeding that is selected for a mother is just the first one in the list that is returned from the database, and that the mother is not retired on.  so if the mother is part of several active breedings, it will not work correctly at all.  But as you mentioned last week, this scenario should never arise so I think we can cancel this ticket as it's FAE.

*edit - reading back through this ticket, it looks like the desired functionality is to limit display of mothers to those that are in the cage, is that what I should do instead?","14/Mar/18 4:15 PM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], [~bkoch], can you give me an update on this ticket.

-----------------
When probes are linked to gene mutations, a conversion from ""+"" ""-"" results to genotypes can be assumed. This feature does not exist in Colony.
The Change
----------------
Provide a user interface representation and back end conversion of results of ""+"" and ""-"" to genotypes. This conversion setup or translation then should allow results returned from Transnetyx genotyping to assign a genotype to a mouse from the sampleID sent in a previous order.
Results are returned from transnetyx and an indication of new results should be displayed to the user. Once viewing the results and suggested conversions to gnotypes, the user should have a method of approving the results conversion and then the genotypes will be assigned to the mouse/pup.

Transgenes linked to probes will link 1 to 1 and provide a result of ""+"" or ""-"" these results will pair to a genotype of present or absent
Genes link to a knock out probe and a wild type probe for detection of zygosity. 

Use this table to determine accurate genotypes from results combinations between the knock out probe and the wild type.

* Order results ""new results display"" -- COMA-1303
* Converting the results to genotypes from these conversion settings (translations) -- COMA-1301

Business Impact
---------------------
This change allow colony users to easily place orders from their mice and gives the organization a method to start removing Labfinity from supported applications.

Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------
Gene mutations paired with probes need to have a table setup for user to identify results from probes is equal to specific genotypes for a gene mutation. -Once these conversions are setup for a gene mutation, they should the save across all strains that share the gene mutation.- << moved to later release as of 1/10/18

-----------------
-The colony application has should allow users to save and assign an order to a user for sample collection and plate preparation. This is a new feature.-

The Change
----------------
Once a user has selected samples for ordering, the sample list should display. The plate can be loaded or just the sample list could be present. The order then should be able to be completed at a later date. The wellplate ID and the plate should not have to be populated to save and assign the order.

*_A future change should allow for notification about the order assignment and alerts that orders have been assigned an awaiting submission_*

-For release 1.1, saving a responsible user and requested user would be sufficien-t. A PDF report should also be available based on the information from the samples list and wellplate assignments. The PDF should be a samples list, plate map, and area to write notes.

Business Impact
---------------------
This change allow colony users to easily place orders from their mice and gives the organization a method to start removing Labfinity from supported applications. Allowing the order to be completed by multiple users more accurately represents what happens in the field when collecting samples and placing orders.

-----------------
The system allows users to select tissue type as a setting that filters down from strain to breeding to litter and eventually mouse/pup. For adult mice that are added to the system from a vendor purchase, these mice should recieve tissue type from the strain level.
The Change
----------------
*_Current tissue type in Quick Order is captured on the strain level but submitted on the order level. Long term solution needs to include tissue type on the sample level. This will require changes to the orderbyfile service for orders._*

When animals are selected for genotyping order, the tissue type should be noted and displayed for the user on the sample list. The tissue type can then be changed for the current order if needed from a drop down list on the sample.
Business Impact
---------------------
This change significantly increases the visibility of tissue type for the cleanroom. This update would also greatly benefit QA in the cleanroom and provide information that may result in identifying issues faster.
Stakeholder
--------------
Team
Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------
Users should be able to change the tissue type per sample on the samples list but default tissue type should be selected from the settings feature in the colony app.

----
Technical Design:

Per voice conversations with [~jmedlock] et al, tissue type is used in the lab to distinguish embryo tissue from other types, since the lysing process is different. Since per-sample tissue types would be inherently allowed by Colony, orders that contain  at least one embryo tissue sample will be flagged as embryonic, as all other tissue type values equate to 'tissue' in quick order.

Created by bwinter on 1/19/2018

+Feature+: _Select tissue type for sample in genotype order_

_As a lab user processing a genotype order, I want the user to specify the tissue type of a sample when placing a genotyping order, so that I can know what tissue type is in which well of a received wellplate._

+Background+: _Genotype order created for mouse or litter_
*Given* that a mouse or litter has been succeffully submitted for a genotype order

This background step assumes that
* the mouse has a linked strain and a biopsy record or 
* the litter has a linked strain, biopsy record, and has been ID's (at least pups generated even if un-sexed)

+Scenario+: _Sample with only one biospy_
*When* I see the sample
*Then* the *one* biopsy record displays as {{<display>}}

+Scenario+: _Sample with more than one biopsy_
*When* I see the sample
*Then* the *most recent* biopsy record is displayed as {{<display>}}

+Examples+:

|| {{<tissue type>}} || {{<biopsy date>}} || {{<display>}} ||
| {{TOE}}        | {{01/01/2018}} | {{TOE 1/1/2018}}          |
| {{TAIL}}      | {{10/10/2017}} | {{TAIL 10/10/2017}}       |
| {{EAR_PUNCH}} | {{12/01/2017}} | {{EAR_PUNCH 12/1/2017}} |
| {{EMBRYO}}    | {{01/01/2018}} | {{EMBRYO 1/1/2018}}        |
| {{ES_CELLS}}  | {{01/01/2018}} | {{ES_CELLS 1/1/2018}}      |
| {{BLOOD}}     | {{01/01/2018}} | {{BLOOD 1/1/2018}}         |

+Scenario+: _Changing biospy record for sample_
*Given* a sample has more than one biopsy record
*When* I click to change the biopsy record
*Then* I see a list of biopsy records for associated mouse sorted descending order by biopsy date (most recent first)
*And* the most recent biopsy is selected by default
*And* I can select another biopsy
*But* I cannot select more than one biopsy per mouse per wellplate order.

Jim's comment isn't strictly correct. When mice / litters are added to the cart and have not been biopsied, the user has the option to biopsy individual mice directly in the cart or litters via the litter workbench. 

The individual biopsy samples (as well as unconsumed existing biopsy samples) would be selected from the dropdown on the order mouse.

The system allows users to create multiple biopsy records for a mouse/pup. These biopsy records need to be shown to the user and genotypes need to be allowed to be related to the biopsied sample.

The Change

-----------------
The system does not have a method to allow a user to turn off probes or gene mutations(allele) for an order.

The Change
----------------
*_Turning on and off gene mutations/probes should be available on the strain level in the first release, with consideration for making this a sample level function in future releases._*

During the order process, when setting up the plate for submitting to Transnetyx for genotyping, the user should be able to turn off gene mutations(allele). The user should also be able to turn off probes.

If a gene mutation is turned off - all probes detecting this gene mutation (Allele) should also be switched off. Meaning the strain will be submitted to transnetyx without these probes to be run on the samples.

*If probes are turned off individually (meaning the KO probe is enabled for a gene mutation but the WT probe is disabled) and the combination of the probes creates the conversion(translation) from results to genotypes, then the auto conversion and populating for genotypes may need to be turned off?*

-----------------

The colony application has settings for a user to supply method of IDs for mice. These IDs can be used to designate a unique sample ID.

The Change
----------------

Once on the samples list for ordering a genotyping test through Transnetyx, the sample IDs should default to the ID method provided in settings that filter down from the strain level, then to breeding, then to litter. If this ID setting is *OFF*, then the IDs for animals should be left to the user to provide. The user could provide these sample IDs by typing them into the sample ID text box or using an ""auto increment.""

The auto increment should allow the user to type in 2 or more sampleIDs per strain group then auto increment the samples. For example: the user enters abc1 and abc2 and selects auto increment. The remaining samples for the strain group would increment by 1 down the list until reaching the end of samples for that strain group.

Business Impact
---------------------

This change allow colony users to easily place orders from their mice and gives the organization a method to start removing Labfinity from supported applications.

Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------

Entering sample IDs should not be a repetitive function for the user. If settings are setup, the system should utilize those settings. If settings are off, an automatic method should exist.

Team
Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------
Gene mutations should be able to pair with probes as a ""detection method"" for the presence/absence of a transgene or the zygosity of the gene.

*Requirements*:
*The strain will need to be linked before these options are presented to the user for R1.1. So the link my probes to a mutation combination will not be available if the strain is not linked that the mutation combination exists.*

_Special handling of the *SNP* probe type_
_Special handling of KO/FL with WT1 and WT2 probes_


Scenario: Pair standard gene mutation KO/WT will pair with 2 probes

Scenario: KO/FL paired with a KO probe, FL probe and (1) WT probe

Scenario: KO/FL paired with KO probe, FL probe and (2) WT probes
*Need User Interface for:* COMA-1973 and COMA-1844
_Pairing probes_ -- Select the mutation to pair to a probe, the user needs to select the probe and select the WT probe to use for that mutation unless the mutation is a transgene.
_Populating the results to genotype conversions_


Need to details scenarios and conversion possibilities for sex linked genes/transgenes and advanced options for transgenes. If this is not possible, we may need to have the user manually select a genotype for these results.
For sex linked genes, if we know the sex of the animal or if the user uses the Y probe we could determine the correct genotypes. Otherwise we will not be able to automatically convert from results to genotypes for these genes.

*Need sex linked genotype conversion tables.*

*Do not allow linking ""hidden"" probes.*
*Allow linking disabled probes*
*Results conversions will ALWAYS be calculated from probes run on the order. Ex:
For KO Mut the KO prb and WT probe are linked.
If WT is not run because the user does not want to run it, only partial conversions can be made. We will only be able to tell the customer KO or WT is present and not the exact genotype.*

Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------
A strain in CM should be able to be linked to a strain in QO provided necessary requirements are met.

*Requirements*:
From the Strain dashboard, provide a transnetyx strain link option. The colony strain will need to be linked before allowing the mutations combinations to be linked to probes. This will shorten the list for users when linking probes.

What account are the strains linked to?
Sub ticket potential changes for order manager group accounts.

When linking strains to transnetyx:
At all times in the linking wizard the customer support email and phone number should be easily accessible and a reminder that if they need help we have a team that can assist them.

Scenario 1:
Strain has no mutations in colony but Tyx strain has probes

Allow link but prompt user on gene mutation section that mutations need to be added to the colony strain.
Ideally we would allow the user to add mutations in this section but for R1.1 we can instruct them to add mutations from the genotype settings then edit the mutation to return to this step.

Scenario 2:
Strain has mutations in colony but 0 Tyx strain has 0 probes

Prompt the user to add probes to the Tyx strain with a link to the correct location in quick order to accomplish the task. Alert the user they will have to refresh to page after adding probes to Tyx strain.

Scenario 3: 
Strain in colony has 0 mutations and Tyx strain has 0 probes

Combination of 1 and 2 needs to happen here. Instruct the user to the correct locations to add mutations and probes and then they can return to this step by editing the mutation link

*Linking drop down of strains also needs to list the probes per strain for easy identification of the strain*

*Rules for linking a strain*
The strain must be setup:
_Must have 1 mutation_
*To place an order with a linked strain:*
_The mutation must be linked to a probe(s)_

----
h3. *Technical Design:*
Both systems will track the strain ID of the other on a per linked strain basis.
OrderManager interop code will be housed in its own assembly withing CM to allow for future conversion to WebAPI methods.

* refer to attached picture *AlleleToProbe_DB_ERD* for new database table ""StrainGeneAlleleProbes"".
* New Enum *DetectionMethods* needs to be added with these values:
** Unknown
** Transnetyx
** Southern Blot
** Realtime PCR
** PCR
** Other

In the Order Manager database, we need to create a junction table with OMStrainId, ColonyStrainId, and DateLinked. 

We need this sort of solution because a OM Strain can be linked to more than one Colony Strain. Here is a potential issue if we just put DateLinked on the Strains table: IF there is an OM Strain that has more than one Colony Strain connected to it, and if someone does something in OM/QO that breaks the link to that Strain, then that link is broken for all Colony Strains that are linked to that OM Strain which is good. However, as soon as one user goes in and fixes just one of Colony Strain links, the system would then consider all of the Colony Strain links valid again instead of forcing all of the links to be re-linked.","07/Sep/17 3:26 PM;rwilliams;Info from Russell on querying OM DB for Strains and Probes:

For Strain I do not think the status matters, EXCEPT for “Deleted” status.
We also probably do not want to allow users to Link “Disabled” Strains, since in Quick Order it does not allow Users to make an Order with a “Disabled” strain.

Strain Query

{code:java}
SELECT *  -- (or whatever you need)
FROM 
       OrderManager.dbo.Strains as s
       INNER JOIN OrderManager.dbo.Users as u on s.UserId = u.UserId
WHERE 
       s.StrainStatusId <> 13  -- 13 is “Deleted”
       AND s.Disabled = 0
       AND (u.UserId = @LeaderUserId 
       OR u.ParentUserId = @LeaderUserId)
{code}


----

For Probes, we just want to EXCLUDE any “Hidden” Probes from being linked… It does not matter if the probe “IsActive” or not because this just means enabled or disabled in the website and either of those can be added to an order.

For testing and finalizing some portions of the development, we have these questions:

For multiple WT strains:
Jim: We narrowed down that only 2 of the mutation probes can ever be positive.
{color:#59afe1}Nate: Yes{color}

Jim: If the first mutation probe is positive and the second mutation probe is negative, the second WT probe must be positive. With this information we can continue to build the matrix for multiple WTs on the same strain.
{color:#59afe1}Nate: Maybe? Might be better to state that in this case if any mutant probe is negative then it’s wildtype probe must be positive. (if Mut1 is negative then WT1 must be positive). There are more rules and I feel like there must be a system. We can discuss further and try to figure it out.{color}

Jim: Is there a limit to the number of mutations on the same gene when genotyping with our service?
{color:#59afe1}Nate: Technically, no. (You can add as many probes in OM as you like and OM has no idea about genes). However, realistically I doubt we see more than 2-3 mutations on a given gene on a mouse/sample{color}

Jim: If we have multiple WTs on a strain with multiple mutations, is there a scenario where 1 of the mutations would have a SNP probe selected?
{color:#59afe1}Nate: Yes{color}

For SNP probes: 
Jim: Would a SNP probe ever be used for a transgene?
{color:#59afe1}Nate: We currently do this for a very few customers after we desperately try to talk them out of it. I think it is ok to not allow this in Colony (at least at first){color}
Jim: If a user selects a SNP probe for a link to a mutation, do they then NOT need to also select the WT probe? 
{color:#59afe1}Nate: Correct (and should not){color}

For Sex Linked genes:
Jim: On the spread sheet we have some missing results. If we cannot auto call those, we should not try to assign a genotype programmatically? (The missing values are on the X- linked Genes.)
{color:#59afe1}Nate: You must know the sex of the mouse to translated probe results to genotype for  sex linked gene. (or you must determine the sex by Y probe result){color}

 [^ResultsGenotypesScenarios Nate update.xlsx] ","08/Jan/18 5:22 PM;bwinter;[~rwilliams], I tried to link strains but LinkWizard threw 500 status.

*What I expected to happen:*

* If my accounts are linked, I expected to be taken to the Strain Linking Wizard.
* Otherwise, I expected to be shown a message that my accounts are not linked and I need to link them in my user profile settings.

Some of this may be happening, because accounts cannot be linked.  I notified [~admin] about it today in COMA-1302.  I have not made this a ticket a re-work yet.  Let me know if I should.
","08/Jan/18 5:31 PM;rwilliams;What group are you in? Once I replicate it I can tell you what’s going on. This is probably a scenario I didn’t ever encounter that I wasn’t smart enough to anticipate…

Thanks,
Richard","08/Jan/18 5:38 PM;rwilliams;OK – I think I might understand the issue. The problem is that you can’t link a strain until you add it to colony . I think it was a mistake to add the “Link Strain” button to this “Add Strain” dialog. At the point that the dialog is open there is no strain created yet. If we want the user to be able to link this newly created strain I suggest we remove that button and we add a “Save and Link” button so that on that click we can save the strain in Colony and then redirect the user to the Link Wizard. I remember seeing that Link button a while back and thinking that will never work there, but I forgot where I had seen it. I believe it was a ticket that Brad completed and I would bet that the requirements called for adding it there.

Thanks,
Richard","10/Jan/18 11:41 AM;bwinter;[~tpatterson] I think the UI/UX needs to be revisited ASAP for linking strains in colony.  There are two places where the user is presented with an opportunity to link strains prior to gene and mutations being created for / added to the strain in Colony.  
 
Starting the Strain Link Wizard before genes and mutations have been set up creates a blocker at Step 2 (Link Probes) of the Strain Link Wizard.  Probes cannot be linked if no gene mutations have been created for / add to the strain.

Two places where Strain Linking presented prior to gene / mutations created:

1. Add new strain
2. Strain Details > Strain Settings\*

\* Note that Strain Settings appears before Genotype Settings in the Strain Details page.

From a process point of view, orders can be created in Quick Order that do not have probes on a strain. Unless we restrict Colony users to wait until the QO strain is completed in assay design, we would want to remove the ability to link a colony strain and quick order strain. Otherwise, we can allow the user to place the order with a strain that is linked but has 0 probes. 
This may require change in the link process(wizard) AND a change in the order process. For the initial release AND prior to building a single location for colony and quick order to reference 1 strain instead of 2 strains linked in software, we could hide the link options until the genes/mutations are present on the strain.
I will get a business decision on that today.

Thanks,
Jim","11/Jan/18 8:37 AM;qevans;[~jmedlock] from our conversation yesterday, I am going to add requirements to hide the Strain Link option from colony strains that have zero mutations, as well as remove QO strains with zero probes from the strain link drop-down.

This appears to be more of a formatting issue than anything.  FYI, there was one result in Step 3 that appeared to be possibly incorrect for the Transgene Advanced SEX-X scenario.

h2. Gene Card
* The gene card seems to place the MutationName on the outside and Transgene in superscript (e.g., {{MutationName<TransgeneName/TransgeneName>}})
** Note that genotype translations formats for gene cards for Transgenes seem to break with format of gene cards for ""regular"" genes
** Gene Cards for ""Regular"" genes format genotype translations as GeneName on outside and MutationName in superscript (e.g., {{GeneName<MutationName/WT>}})
* *Examples*
** *Transgene - Advanced*
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/0>}}
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/TransgeneName>}}
*** {{MutationName<0/0>}}
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/?>}}
** *Transgene - Advanced - SEX-X*
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/Y>}}
*** {{MutationName<0/Y>}}
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/0>}}
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/TransgeneName>}}
*** {{MutationName<0/0>}}
*** {{MutationName<TransgeneName/?>}}

h2. Step 3 of Link Wizard

* Step 3 translations seem to break with both the gene card and the Nate/Rich spreadsheet
** {color:#d04437}{{MutationName}} {color} is used in place of {{TransgeneName}}.
** Some translations use superscript notation {color:#d04437}{{<>}}{color}, some do not.
** Some translations use {color:#d04437}{{WT}}{color}, where a {{0}} was expected.
* *Examples*
** *Transgene - Advanced*
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}/{color:#d04437}WT{color}}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}/{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}{color:#d04437}<{color}0/0{color:#d04437}>{color}}}
** *Transgene - Advanced - SEX-X*
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}/Y}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}{color:#d04437}<{color}0/Y{color:#d04437}>{color}}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}/{color:#d04437}WT{color}}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}/{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}}}
*** {{{color:#d04437}MutationName{color}{color:#d04437}<{color}0/0{color:#d04437}>{color}}}
*** One translation appears to be incorrect: {color:#d04437}Gives {{MutationName<0/0>}} instead of {{0/Y}} (or something similar that denotes the mouse has a Y chromosome)

h2. Nate/Rich Spreadsheet

* The Nate/Rich spreadsheet just lists the allelic combination, which is what appears to be in the superscript of most non-transgene translations

*** {{0/0}}
** *Transgene - Advanced - SEX-X*

*** {{0/0}}","04/Apr/18 12:03 PM;rwilliams;[~bwinter] Regarding your last comments... 
*+Transgene Advanced X Linked scenario (Gene: Transgene22)+*: It looks like there is something not working quite right for the Transgene Advanced X Linked scenario (Gene: Transgene22). The displayed genotype appears to be wrong. I also see that the Transgene:Advanced badge (displayed as a blue bubble just beside the Sex Linked: X badge) in the header is missing. There is something wrong there, For additional info, the Transgene:Advanced badge is showing properly on the Step 2 page for this Transgene. So, I think on this one there is something wrong either with the Engine or with the setup of the Engine (all in code), and I think that if we fix that it will probably fix the genotype as well.
*+Transgene Advanced scenario+*: For this scenario it look like it it translating ok, but something does look off with the displayed genotype. Also, the same is true with the Transgene:Advanced badge. That may be what is causing the issue with both of these cases.
Bottom line, I think we need a bug ticket to look into this. You may want to piggy back on a bug ticket that [~qevans] is going to create for me related to the Mosaic option not working correctly for Probe Linking Step 3 as well. I hope this is a simple fix that will fix all of these issues at the same time.

Created 01/22/2018 by Bryan Winter

+Feature+: _Marks samples as control_

_As a user, I want to mark samples in a wellplate as control, so that I can verify that the Transnetyx genotyping results matches my own._

_As the Transnetyx CEO, I want the customers to have 5 free control samples per strain -per wellplate order-, so that Transnetyx can get prospect customers to give Transnetyx a try for each of their strains._

_As the Transnetyx CEO,  I want customers to pay for every control sample beyond the 5th control sample, so that we are not giving samples away for free._

*Note:* 
* Users who submit samples marked as control presumably already know that that samples genotype and want to use the control samples to verify Transnetyx's process.
* Currently, customers get 5 free samples per strain per order.
* Soon this logic will change to a threshold.
* {color:#59afe1}*This logic has changed as of April 18, 2018 to 5 free control samples per strain (ever), and this logic will likely change again after this code is release to PROD.*{color}

*Then* I can see that that sample is marked as control.

+Scenario+: _Mark all samples in a strain as control_
*Given* that I am at the wellplate order page
*When* I mark all samples in a strain as control
*Then* I can see that all the samples in that strain are marked as control

*Then* I can see on the finalization page in Colony that I am charged {{<strain total>}} for that strain
*And* from Quick Order, I can see the strain in my order was charged {{<strain total>}} for that strain

Check box with text ""Omit""
Once selected all samples in the strain group are marked/flagged as omitted for the current well plate/order

Each sample should be allowed to be omitted from a check box/menu item
Check box with omit next to each sample

h1. SQA Notes
Created 01/23/2018 by Bryan Winter

+Feature+: _Marks samples as omit_

_As a user, I want to omit samples in a wellplate for storage, so that I can have Transnetyx store the sample for a period of time for whatever reason._

_As the Transnetyx CEO, I want samples marked omit to be free to the customer and to have no assays run against them._

*Note:* 
* Users who submit samples marked as omit do not want any genotyping done on those samples, and since we do not charge them, we (Transnetyx) also do not want to genotype them to save money and time.

+Scenario+: _Mark a sample as omit one-by-one_
*Given* that I am at the wellplate order page
*When* I mark a sample as omit
*Then* I can see that that sample is marked as omit.

+Scenario+: _Mark all samples in a strain as omit_
*Given* that I am at the wellplate order page
*When* I mark all samples in a strain as omit
*Then* I can see that all the samples in that strain are marked as omit.

+Scenario+: _Do not test for omit samples_
*Given* that I have submitted an order with omit samples
*When* I finalize and submit my wellplate order
*Then* from Quick Order, I can see that the samples marked omit do not have probes ordered for them.

+Scenario+: _Do not charge for omit samples_
*Given* that I have a strain on the wellplate order page with {{<probes>}} number of probes and {{<samples>}} number of samples with {{<omit>}} marked omit
*When* I finalize and submit my wellplate order
*Then* I can see on the finalization page in Colony that I am charged {{<strain total>}} for that strain
*And* from Quick Order, I can see the strain in my order was charged {{<strain total>}} for that strain

+Examples+:

This option will place the pups that are being biopsied into an area that can be loaded into a Transnetyx plate.

The current idea of staging samples for validation (shopping cart) may be revisited. 

How it is now
-----------------
Currently the litter workbench only allows save and cancel
The Change
----------------
Add a button ""Send to Transnetyx"" that allows the selected biopsy samples to be prepared for a transnetyx order
The send to transnetyx button should use the data provided from the customer regarding date biopsied, tissue type
ID = Sample ID

Placing an order in quick order requires:
* Strain IDs linked from Order manager ==> Lims *Colony Manager Strains must be linked to a strain that exists in OM and is available in LIMS*
* Unique sample ID across the *same* strain on *same* order
* Tissue Type (Currently this is by plate but long term needs to be by sample) *Do we validate tissue type?* *For Release 1 of Ordering and Results, tissue type should be related to the plate. Tissue Type changes to be related to samples would need to be changes in Order manager first.*
* Alleles on Strain are linked to a probe in QuickOrder

*Can LIMS handle tissue type by sample?*
LIMS does not care where tissue type is located i.e. on sample level, strain level, order level.

How it is now
-----------------
No validation or preparation of samples step is included in Colony manager
The Change
----------------
After a user selects samples for genotyping, then a sample validation step needs to occur. This full screen ""shopping cart"" area should display samples on the order and objects that need to be corrected before the order can be placed. For objects that need significat correction, such as strain cannot be linked to Tyx before ordering, there needs to be a remove sample/samples option as well.
Business Impact
---------------------
Creates a way to validate data that will create an order in Transnetyx quick order and reduces support needed on these orders.

We do have several versions of mockups of the Orders List and the status warnings, so I can decide on an overall feel for this.

-----------------
When a user access the results from a genotyping order for the first time, they should need to review the suggested conversion from colony app and approve the genotypes to be assigned to mice. This feature is a new feature to Colony.
The Change
----------------
From the results notification UI (COMA-1303), the users should be able to access results. If the first time viewing results the user should be presented an option to make the genotypes from the the conversions the genotype of the mice that were sent as samples.
Business Impact
---------------------
This change allow colony users to easily place orders from their mice and gives the organization a method to start removing Labfinity from supported applications.
Stakeholder
--------------
Team
Acceptance Criteria:
-------------------------
When the user accesses results from an order for the first time, the conversion (translations) from results to genoytpes should be presented to the user and a genotype these animals selection should be available.

*Confirmed: We need to have the user review the results in Colony before the genotypes are assigned to the mouse.*

*The genotypes applied to mice from the result to genotype conversions from Transnetyx results should be clear to the user. Specifically a user applied genotype and a transnetyx result should be separate entries on the mouse and a genotype history should be available.*




*Requirements*:
_Retesting? CIR? PDF export ? XML?_ _*All these features should be available in Quick Order for release 1.1, there needs to be a link from Colony to Quick Order that does not force the user to log in meaning the accounts are the same.

Once the user applies the genotype from the order, they would need to set genotypes for this list of mice a different way.

The only thing that makes me think the other way is the event of retests. In this case, which I am not sure we are handling in the colony order process yet, the user would need to manually apply a genotype. We may need to investigate this asap to determine how to handle it. I will get an answer for this.

Thanks,
Jim","14/Nov/17 12:04 PM;jmedlock;[~bkoch] The 1 time review should mean this:
Once a user views the results the first time AND applies the genotypes to the mice, then the ability to apply those same genotypes to the mice should not be present. If the user does not apply the genotypes from the ""Apply Genotypes"" button, then the ability should persist until the user chooses to apply them.

This will only not be the case in the scenario involving retests or partial completed orders that complete in multiple stages. We need a ticket to handle these scenarios, i will start working on that ticket.

Jim","27/Jan/18 6:10 AM;bkoch;Hey [~jmedlock], I was looking back through this ticket and noticed that we need to treat retests and partially completed orders that complete in multiple stages differently.

At the UI level, we will need a widget that informs the user that new results have been assigned with UI notification messages that link them to the appropriate mice.

","25/Oct/17 5:04 PM;tpatterson;[~admin] + [~bkoch] : For the time being, I think we should toss the [task icon|http://fontawesome.io/icon/tasks/] in the navbar, have the number badges appear on the upper right hand corner as results roll in, and, on click, have it send user to the Orders List, so that they can view and drill into their completed result(s).

Possible future feature:
Per a discussion that [~jmedlock] and I had, sometime down the line, we could easily roll all tasks or notifications into this tasks icon / indicator. We could change the on click action to something similar to what we have in the chat icon. A window would drop down, the most recent notifications could be viewed or drilled into from this window, and, depending on the amount of notifications in this window, we could add a ""see all"" button on the bottom allowing the user to navigate to a tasks / notifications page. From here they could see all other tasks or notifications and view or drill in from there.","02/Nov/17 7:38 AM;bkoch;[~admin], do we have the overall schema that we need to store and display on these objects?

This will ensure that a users Colony Manager credentials provides access to Address, Payment, and other account data necessary to process genotyping orders which are stored in QuickOrder/OrderManager.

* The UserProvider database will be the system of record for all Colony Manager Users.

* An Account Creation page will either be created in a themed Colony Manager set of views, or seamless pass-through to the existing registration page(s) will be developed such that Colony Manager users can access, enter, and manager pertinent ordering specific metadata.

* The intended state will be that all Colony Manager users will also be QuickOrder users, and will have full access to their account metadata through integration or pass through navigation.

* In pass through scenarios, modification to the QuickOrder/OrderManager application will be required allow the correct user workflow and navigation based on origin, with links returning users to their correct landing pages, etc.

* Synchronization of QuickOrder user account will be developed such that existing QuickOrder customers who wish to utilize the Colony Manager application will require no steps other than login and group setup.

* At a minimum, group owner / member management must developed to allow organizational users to be added, removed, or modified by a central account authority.

* Analysis is required to determine if a permissions system should be in place to allow non-owner users to have management functionality and/or ordering capability from the Colony Manager application (delegate account scenario).
----

*Technical Design Notes:*

Colony Account owners will have the ability to specify whether their account is linked to their QuickOrder account via the individuals Account Management page.
The system will generate a single use bearer token (backed by new schema, TransnetyxUserProvider.[dbo].[AuthorizationTokenRequests]. Tokens are issued on account update when no redeemed token is found for the specified user and purpose.

[Identity bearer tokens are hashed by the Purpose string, so the authorization tokens can be issued for anything we need in the future. TwoFactor will probably be the next usecase]

The token is sent via email, and then authenticated as part of the messages link payload. This flags the account as linked, which the order submission methods check before allowing QuickOrder data access (Strain Linking, Order Placement, etc).

for the main work on this ticket.","08/Jan/18 5:15 PM;bwinter;[~admin]

What happened:

# Went to Account > Profile > Automated Genotyping
# Select Link my account check
# Clicked Save Profile
# Nothing happened
# Refreshing browser showed Link my account check as unchecked.
# Behind the scenes: UpdateProfile threw 500 status

What I expected to happen:

* After linking accounts and clicking Save Profile, I expected to receive a notification that my settings were saved.
* After refreshing my browser after saving, I expected my Link my account check to remain checked.","23/Jan/18 4:54 PM;bwinter;[~tpatterson] and [~jmedlock] We may need some UX love for the account linking side of Colony.  We may need to evaluate whether it is clear to the user whether linking accounts to QO is even necessary.

For example, consider a Colony User is invited to someone's Active Group.  The Active Group owner has *not* linked their Colony account to Quick Order.  The current UX implementation suggests that the problem is with the Colony user invited to the Active Group.  This user will receive a message similar to ""Your account is not linked to QO.""  However, they should really be notified that their Active Group owner's account is not linked to QO, because creating a QO account may not solve their problem with finding the strains in the Active Group owner's account.","25/Jan/18 11:25 AM;tpatterson;Couldn't agree with you more, [~bwinter]. We should definitely schedule a meeting to brainstorm fixes for these current UX issues and opportunities to push more efficient / profitable approaches to working in our software environments.","07/Feb/18 10:29 AM;bwinter;[~admin], [~jmedlock] I am trying to think through the expected behavior of account linking in Colony if the user were to 

# *link* account, 
# save profile, 
# *unlink* account, 
# save profile, 
# start over at Step 1.

And the user repeated this loop several times for a period of time.  How many link-account emails should be generated?  

* One for each link account -> Save profile event?
* One per hour regardless of how many times linked/unlinked?
* One per day?

By link-account email, I mean this one:

Given that I am a new user to Colony
And I do not have a QO account
When I click ""click here to learn more"" link in the Account Profile page
Then ... _what should the modal read?_

Currently, the modal says this

""Account Linking
QuickOrder Account Linking in Colony
You can now link your QuickOrder genotyping account to your Colony account in two easy steps:

Connect your Transnetyx accounts by {color:#d04437}activating the toggle below{color}.
You will need to verify your account by confirming the correct email address.
Once your email has been verified, you and members of your research group(s) can link Colony strains to your QuickOrder strains, place genotyping orders, track order statuses, view results, and assign genotypes within Colony.""

There is no toggle switch, because the user does not have a QO account yet.

Should we remove the link?

 !consider changing modal language - 2018-03-01 11_47_12-.png|thumbnail! ",01/Mar/18 12:06 PM;jmedlock;[~bwinter] [~jcox] there should be a different message there for non quick order users. That tells them about automated genotyping and a link to register for quick order. However this will be a while before we need that and it may change. Removing the link may be best for non-quick order users for now. We likely will not invite non-quick order users for 2018,"01/Mar/18 12:13 PM;bwinter;[~jmedlock], [~jcox] Roger that.","01/Mar/18 1:03 PM;bwinter;[~admin] Would it be a quick fix to have the link to QO in Colony QA point to QA2 instance of QO instead of PROD instance?  I keep accidentally creating PROD QO accounts when clicking that link, because I forget it is pointing to PROD QO instead of QA2 QO.

This feature will allow the user to designate the sample layout of genotyping material in a wellplate drag and drop UI paradigm.
The user logs in to the system and navigates to a Mouse, Litter or Cage editor view.
From the selected view, the user is presented an option to initiate the order process with the given the mouse/mice/pups in context.
A Colony Manager order record is created, and wellplate records are generated based on the samples assigned from each mouse.
If an existing partial order exists for the wellplate number assigned, prompt the user to reconcile that problem.
The main navigation bar will display an item in the cart for the order until the order has been finalized and the submission process has been followed (See Order Submission ticket)
*
Steps we must account for
Wellplate Barcode Name MUST be added to the plate (Important: This should be first Step)
Applying Alleles to test for on a given sample(s) – (This covers turning probes on or off)
For the first release of orders and results, we need to mirror Quick Order. Turning on/off probes(Alleles) for the strain group and not the individual mouse.
Allow ability to mark samples as Control Samples (Current Quick Order language needs to be present regarding 5 free controls) Controls-Language.png
Allow ability to mark samples as Omitted
Allow ability to Skip Wells (a.k.a “Empty Wells”)
What we can infer dragging a mouse a well location:
Mouse Name (Mouse ID) – aka Sample Name in TYX.
This IS REQUIRED
This MUST be a unique name across the strain across the order.
Ampersands (&), Single and Double quotes are not allowed in sample names.
Strain for the mouse sample
With strain we get Alleles (Probes)
Well location of the Sample (Obvious, but it is needed data info)
The rest of the needed order info can be delegated to Quick Order Step 3 of the order process.",04/Jan/18 10:33 AM;bwinter;[~admin] This ticket seems more like an epic than a story.,10/Jan/18 9:15 AM;bwinter;[~admin] Can we fast-track this ticket to QA?,10/Jan/18 10:42 AM;admin;[~bwinter] Done,"18/Jan/18 9:53 PM;bwinter;h1.

We only mark each mouse as dead and take the litter out of the cage when doing a Bulk Mark Dead.  There are no deathDate and deathType fields in the litter entity for iOS.  So on the web side the cart does not know that the litter is dead and it stays in the cart and has the missing info icons.

I just now noticed that this problem exists on master as well so its not a problem with this new build.  This is a bug with ""Bulk Mark Dead"" for cages.

CMI-50 adds a new 'Mark Entire Litter as Dead' menu option but adding this in on its own still won't fix this ticket since it doesn't deal with cages.  

I would prefer to push this off until the next release if possible.  We should add CMI-50 to that release as well since it is related.  

","28/Aug/18 9:05 AM;jstrickland;[~fdobjenschi] . Please see CMI-50 for more info but I've combined CMI-50 and this ticket into the CMI-298 branch.  This should be ready for review now.

Carrie's suggestions were to:
Mark all mice dead and any litters completely contained in this cage as dead.  If any litters are partially contained in this cage prompt the user:
""Cage X contains some litters that have pups that are not in this cage.  Mark those pups/litters dead as well?""

Yes does it and No does not mark any pups/litters outside of the cage as dead.  The pups in the cage and litters completely contained in the cage are still marked dead though.

h1. What I expected to happen

I expected that sex'ing pups on iOS would not change pup count on Web.

h1. DEV Notes

h2. From [~jstrickland]:

So I’ve been going thru the cage counts stuff and hit a totally unrelated error I think.  Wasn’t sure if there was a ticket on it or not but here’s the info.  

I only made changes on iOS and verified them on the web after syncing each step.

So on iOS I created a new litter w/2 pups (synced and verified on the web).  Then I assigned a sex to both pups (1 M/1 F if that matters) and no biopsy.  I verified 2 pups were showing on iOS and that 2 mice (1M/1F) were sent in the sync.  Synced and 3 pups are showing on the web side in the cage view.  Happens consistently on both dev and qa.

I double checked the sync and its definitely only sending 2 mice up.  That would be the obvious problem but that’s not it.

h2. Comment from [~jstrickland] on 07/13/2018

Two mice were assigned a sex and two are sent in the sync but the litter pupCountAtBirth is set to 3 instead of 2. The web side will show 3 Pups since this data is incorrect causing the discrepancy.

h2. Comment from [~jstrickland] on 07/16/2018

This was pretty difficult to pin down. Sometimes when you manually entered a pup's sex (instead of clicking the sex icon) the pup count would be one too many in the sync.

Moved the calculation for IDing number of pups to updateOffspring and added additional logic to didPressSaveButton since adding pups after a litter was ID'ed was affected.

This should be ready for review and is on its own branch.

From their message:

When weaning a litter, (already at the workbench stage), long genotypes are cut off. Clicking on the mouse for details yields another screen where long genotypes are cut off. Then you must click edit, and yet again click in the genotypes window to finally view the full genotype. This is WAY too deep to be able to quickly compare mouse to mouse. Some solution needs to exist where a full genotype can be viewed without diving so deep into submenus and clicks.


Then Tyler responded:

Right now, the mouse cell does not handle super long genotypes. However, the mouse card does and the mouse card is now the default window that appears when you tap the mouse cell from the workbench. Previously it was not.


But they are not satisfied:

UAT not approved \- full genotypes need to be visible from the workbench view because often users may be looking at the genotypes to determine how they assign the mice to cages. If they have to click on every single mouse to view the genotypes before they move each mouse one by one this adds unnecessary time to the weaning process.",11/Jul/18 8:47 PM;jstrickland;Should show over 100 chars on the mouse cell and mouse card now for genotype and shrink text as needed.

When a litter is biopsied from iOS, it shows as NOT biopsied in the Shopping Cart (via the purple Needs Biopsy icon in Required Actions column of the Cart).  This only happens when a litter is biopsied from iOS, so [~jmedlock] and I were thinking that it may be from the iOS side.

If you see that there is nothing from the iOS side or happening in the sync, then we may need to have [~admin] look it.

CC: [~cleduc]","12/Jun/18 4:17 PM;jmedlock;[~bwinter] [~jstrickland] [~admin] I am pretty sure that this is because the mice records are not getting a biopsy date and the order is looking for a biopsy date on the mouse records. What needs to happen is add the biopsy on iOS when the litter is biopsied to the mouse records

","13/Jun/18 2:43 PM;jstrickland;[~admin] [~jmedlock] [~bwinter]
iOS is sending the litter date biopsied in the sync and the database and web show it correctly.  Compared the web and iOS and the problem definitely seems tied to iOS but all of the litter data looks correct and the same as the web version to me.  There aren't any fields in the mouse table that I could see that are related to biopsy.  Litter has DateBiopsied but its saved correctly.  IsBiopsied and TissueTypeCd in the Litter table do not appear to be used so that is probably not the problem either.

Also I took a web generated biopsy (so no icon showing) and removed the biopsy date, id date and the icon never appeared even though the web says that there is no biopsy date, no id date, and a biopsy and id are needed.  Just trying to go back until it showed the icon to see what it was checking for.  I'm doing all of this in dev if that matters.

Do we know what the criteria is for showing that icon?   ","13/Jun/18 2:49 PM;jmedlock;[~jstrickland][~admin] Then perhaps there needs to be a biopsy record created for the mice? Chris can you chime in here?

","14/Jun/18 10:14 AM;bwinter;[~jstrickland], from our Skype meeting today with [~admin], it appears that we need to check on these two possible scenarios that could be causing the issue found in this ticket:

Background

We thought this bug had been resolved but apparently it can still be reproduced.  This is a clone the original ticket to track the new effort to resolve the issue.  Original ticket text below...

Even though we made some recent changes to the CageDetails edit form to prevent RackId from being set and RackIndex from being null, it is happening elsewhere in the app. I suspect that perhaps when a litter is weaned possibly, that the room/rack is copied from the parent cage but the RackIndex is left null.

If it isn't there, then perhaps some dragging and dropping in the cage map? 

We just need to prevent the scenario from occurring.

I think what may be happening is that iOS is pulling in old genes that were removed from the strain at some point in Web.  See screen shots below.

[~fdobjenschi], [~jstrickland], can either of you confirm if this is a result of this code in CIM-263 or if this is a new story/bug that needs to be created?

We have pice of code in place that remove the relationship on a Entity that has dateDeleted != NULL so i had no relationship from StrainGene to StrainGeneAlleles to check for dateDeleted , this was the reason for asking about schema  :)

As far as i checked every not deleted StrainGene has a StrainGeneAllele relation on it , so now i made a check if StrainGene has no StrainGeneAllele relationship then is deleted and in this way is prevented to be showed .

Now when the logout is requested i made some changes to be sure that the Synchronisation in progress is finished with no problems and all the data is deleted properly .

I know know we spent countless hours on some of these initial designs to make sure we had the absolute minimum information necessary on these views and we never had a use case for needing to see the cage IDs at that level. It was unlikely, in our minds, that the user was going to pull up the cage map and just scan their eyes over the whole thing until they found the cage ID they wanted. 

The primary reasons for going to the cage map were to (1) get a quick estimate of rack and cage density and (2) see a rough location of a cage that I already searched/filtered/navigated to from a litter/mouse/breeding.  When needing to go to a specific cage you will be coming from a litter, breeding, or mouse list. Those flows were coming from the mouse list (searching for breeders), litters list (clicking on a specific litter), or from the breeding card. The location of the cage (Room/Rack/Position) is visible via navigation from all of those places in iOS.","01/Mar/18 8:32 AM;jcox;Thanks, [~fdobjenschi]!

Currently the filter (HasLivingOffspring == YES) is excluding these litters even though it should not be.

I've narrowed the issue to line 534 in ColonyAPIManager+Predicate, ""NSPredicate *foundDeadMissingPredicate"" and it is because we can't perform addition inside the predicate (foundDeadCount + missingCount) < numberOfPups). 

I thought about taking the ColonyAPIQueryParamHasLivingOffspring out of the NSPredicate and just performing some filtering afterwards on the list of litters, but we have tightly integrated everything to be performed at the time of the request.

If we had a way to perform some 'post fetch filtering' that might help.",,,,;23/Feb/18 10:49 AM;jmedlock;1800,,,,,,,,,0,1800,,,0,1800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tposchel,fdobjenschi,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tposchel,,Rework,Unassigned,,jmedlock,0|i00uzz:,,,,,,,New Product/Feature,,,2018-02-08 11:01:00.517,"06/Feb/18 10:08 AM;tposchel;[~fdobjenschi] This is something I'd like you to look at tomorrow morning ahead of Ordering and results.

I'm investigating. I don't know what the issue with Issue#1 is yet.,"31/Aug/17 3:35 PM;rwilliams;[~tposchel] I went through the payload information for litters and litter parents. There appear to be litter parents for SIX litters, but there are only FIVE litters included in the payload and the missing litter is not already in the database. See the last attachment for the litter and litter parent information organized by litter id. Below are the litter parents that don't have a litter to be able to join to. Is it possible that the iOS app didn't create a litter record when it should have? Let me know what you think. At this point I don't think that the issue is with the sync unless we want it to work differently in situations like this.

There are still some UIAlertView references into code like delegates , and also will be nice to remove all comments related to this story , i don't think is really useful to have it because we have git history with comments .

Just make a search for UIAlertView in project to find them .

2 possibilities:

This happened a while back with MouseGeneResults. We would send multiple MouseGeneResults and only one would be returned in the response.
# We are calculating the number of changes incorrectly. This was also an issue where we were saving ""local changes"" even when the user tapped ""Cancel' and deleted the records. Then the LocalChanges table thought that we had a record, but then when the JSON was created, it was empty because no actual records existed.

Basically, our primary option to improve here is to have the web send us numbers of seconds since epoch instead of formatted date strings. Another option might be to save the string value into Core Data and then have accessor methods on each YXBaseEntity for fetching those dates. For example, ""dateCreated"" would be stored as a string in CD under perhaps ""dateCreatedStr"". Then whenever you reference ""dateCreated"" it returns the converted date.

Both filters DOB and Age are related to the same filtering parameters : 
ColonyAPIQueryParamDOBBefore
ColonyAPIQueryParamDOBAfter

Now if you apply a filter on DOB or Age when you come back to filtering list both filters will be active and populated correctly because of they are using the same filter parameter.

To mark a litter as dead we are sending up deathType and deathDate (along with found dead, missing, culled count) as Tyler suggested.  Looking at the litter table I see DeathDate and LitterDeathReasonCd but neither is populated with this data after a sync so I'm not sure if there is something else that needs to be done or not.  

On the web side a litter marked as dead from iOS gets removed from the litter list which seems correct.  If its in the cart along with samples it will zero out the Qty and show the missing samples/info icons again.  Not sure if this is the expected behavior or not though.

If we need to make any changes please let me know.
